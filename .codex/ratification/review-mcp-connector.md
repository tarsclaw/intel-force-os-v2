# Codex ratification skill — review-mcp-connector

Apply this skill on top of `.codex/ratification/SKILL.md` (five rules + four boundaries + honest-signal checks; bias toward REJECT) when reviewing a TypeScript MCP connector package under `packages/mcp-connectors/<name>/`.

An MCP connector is a self-contained TypeScript workspace package that wraps a single upstream provider (Companies House, Xero, Bullhorn, etc.) and exposes capabilities consumed by `agents/*/cycle.sh`. Reference implementation: `packages/mcp-connectors/companies-house/` (Day-13 RATIFIED). Every new connector mirrors that pattern.

This skill ADDS 7 checks on top of `SKILL.md`. Any one failing = REJECTED.

## §1 — Capabilities surface

Every capability declared in the connector's `tools.yaml` (or per-agent `tools.yaml` referencing this connector) MUST have a corresponding TypeScript function exported from the package's `src/index.ts`. Reverse also: every exported public function intended as a capability MUST appear in the README's "Capabilities" table.

**Verify by:**
1. Open `src/index.ts`; list exported functions.
2. Open `README.md`; list the capabilities table.
3. Grep `agents/*/tools.yaml` for the connector name; list capabilities referenced.
4. The three sets MUST be identical (set-equal). Missing on either side = REJECT.

Pre-build connector exception: if the connector is W4-W7 scaffold (no agent yet), check #3 may be empty; checks #1 + #2 must still match.

## §2 — OAuth refresh idempotency

Connectors that handle OAuth (Xero / QuickBooks / Bullhorn / TrueLayer / Plaid / Microsoft Graph / Gmail) MUST:

1. Have an `oauth_refresh` capability (or equivalent) that can be safely called concurrently. Concurrent calls converge on a single token rotation — no torn `_secrets.env` writes.
2. Use atomic file replacement on token updates (write to `.tmp` + `rename`; never partial-write to the live `_secrets.env`).
3. Have at least one vitest verifying concurrent-refresh safety (e.g. `Promise.all([refresh(), refresh(), refresh()])` produces one rotated token, not three torn files).

REJECT if any of those are missing or if `_secrets.env` is opened with `fs.writeFile` mid-flow without a rename guard.

## §3 — Rate-limit budget declared

README MUST cite:
1. The upstream rate-limit (calls/min, calls/day, calls/window) with a clickable URL to the provider's published limits page.
2. The connector's chosen safety margin (typically 80% of upstream cap) and the in-process bucket implementation reference (token-bucket / sliding-window / fixed-window).
3. The ESC code fired on bucket exhaustion (`ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` with `payload.upstream='<provider>'`).

REJECT if any are missing, OR if the safety margin >100% of upstream (the bucket would never throttle), OR if no test exercises bucket exhaustion.

## §4 — Explicit retry policy

For every state-changing capability (writes, OAuth refresh, anything non-idempotent at the upstream):

1. Max retries declared (typically 1-3 depending on operation cost).
2. Backoff strategy declared (typical: exponential w/ jitter; or fixed-delay for OAuth refresh).
3. ESC code on retry-budget exhaustion (`ESC_<PROVIDER>_WRITE_FAIL` or equivalent).
4. README documents which capabilities retry vs which fail-fast.

REJECT if any capability has implicit retry forever (e.g. `while(true) { try { ... } catch { sleep(1s) } }` with no max).

## §5 — No secret logs

REJECT immediately on any of these in the package source (`src/` + `tests/`):

```
console.log(`...${KEY}...`)            // any credential variable interpolated into log
console.error(`...${SECRET}...`)
throw new Error(`...${PASSWORD}...`)
JSON.stringify(envWithSecrets)
```

**Verify by:**
- `grep -rE "console\.(log|error|warn).*\\\$\{.*(KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD|TOKEN|BEARER)" packages/mcp-connectors/<name>/`
- `grep -rE "throw\s+new\s+Error.*\\\$\{.*(KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD)" packages/mcp-connectors/<name>/`

Must return zero matches outside of fixture/test mocks. Mock test-fakes (e.g. `'fake-key'`) are fine; real credential variable names interpolated into output strings are not.

## §6 — Fixture-first tests

Every capability MUST have ≥1 vitest fixture exercising the canonical success path, AND ≥1 fixture exercising an error path (4xx, 5xx, rate-limit, malformed response — at least one). Live API calls behind an env-var gate that defaults OFF in CI:

```typescript
const LIVE = process.env.MCP_LIVE_TESTS === 'true';
describe.skipIf(!LIVE)('live tests', () => { ... });
```

REJECT if:
- Any capability has only happy-path fixtures (no error case).
- Tests make live API calls when `MCP_LIVE_TESTS` is unset.
- Fixtures are inline strings >100 lines (move to `fixtures/*.json`).
- Fixture data contains real PII or real credentials (use shape-preserving fakes).

## §7 — decision_log integration

Every state-changing capability emits a `decision_log` row via `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh` `hh_decision_action` (or `hh_decision_output` for read-only outputs). The `action_type` argument MUST exist in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` with the tier the connector documents in its README.

For the connector itself (TypeScript), the emission is by a shell wrapper (e.g. cycle.sh) that consumes the connector's output — not by the connector directly. So the check is:

1. README's "Capabilities" table includes a `action_type` column for each state-changing capability.
2. Every listed `action_type` exists in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`.
3. The tier README claims for each matches the tier in `autosend-policy.yaml`.

REJECT if a capability's documented action_type is absent from the policy YAML or has a different tier. If a new action_type is needed, the connector's README MUST mark it as "proposed; add to autosend-policy.yaml in same commit" — and the YAML edit MUST land in the same PR/commit.

## §8 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

REJECT immediately if any of these appear in the connector source or fixtures:

- The strings `composio` or `agentmail` (case-insensitive) — adapter boundary per master brief §3.
- Imports from `packages/harness/cortextos/` (submodule boundary; the connector is in `packages/mcp-connectors/` and must not depend on the cortextOS submodule).
- Direct writes to `decision_log` from the connector (vault/Postgres split per ADR-002 — only the shell `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` writes Postgres; connectors return data, the agent's cycle.sh persists).
- Hardcoded tenant slugs (`migration-test`, `test-tenant-b`, etc.) in `src/` outside of test fixtures.

## §9 — Output contract for this skill

```
RATIFIED
[optional 0-5 lines of advisory notes — minor wording, suggested README clarifications, deferred-to-next-touch items]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing the specific file + line/section + the §N rule above that failed>. <one-line proposed concrete fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

...
```

Do NOT use "RATIFIED-with-significant-changes" — that's REJECTED. Bias toward REJECT per `SKILL.md` §6.

## §10 — Common false-RATIFY traps

Watch for these — they look fine on a skim but fail substantively:

- **README rate-limit cite without test:** documented but no test exercises bucket exhaustion. §3 requires both.
- **OAuth refresh that updates env vars in-process but never writes to disk:** the next process starts fresh and re-prompts. Atomic disk write is required.
- **Capability with documented retry budget but no jitter:** N synchronous retries against a 429 hammer the rate-limiter further. Backoff + jitter is the standard.
- **Error path tests that mock the HTTP layer but never assert the ESC code fires:** the test passes; the production failure mode silently swallows. Assert the ESC emission.
- **action_type added to autosend-policy.yaml as "yellow" but README claims "green":** tier mismatch = REJECT per §7.
- **Pre-build connector with `MCP_LIVE_TESTS` not yet wired:** acceptable IF README marks the live tests as "wired at first commercial signup." Note as advisory not REJECT.

## §11 — Quick checklist

For RATIFIED, every box must be ✓:

- [ ] Capabilities surface: tools.yaml ↔ src/index.ts exports ↔ README capabilities table are set-equal
- [ ] OAuth refresh idempotent + atomic-file-write + concurrent-safety test (if connector has OAuth)
- [ ] Rate-limit cited from upstream docs + safety margin documented + bucket-exhaustion test exists
- [ ] Explicit retry policy: max + backoff + ESC code + README documents per-capability
- [ ] Zero credential-variable interpolations in `console.*` / `throw new Error`
- [ ] Every capability has ≥1 happy-path + ≥1 error-path fixture; live tests gated on `MCP_LIVE_TESTS=true`
- [ ] All documented action_types exist in `autosend-policy.yaml` with matching tier
- [ ] No Composio/AgentMail/cortextOS-submodule-import/hardcoded-tenant-slug boundary violations
