# Codex ratification skill — review-architecture-decision

Type-specific checks for: ADRs (`docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`), decision docs (`docs/decisions/*.md` other than ADRs), reference designs (`docs/architecture/*.md`), runbooks (`docs/runbooks/*.md`).

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

---

## §1 — Decision-doc shape requirements

Every artefact of this type MUST have:

1. **Status field** — one of `Proposed | Accepted | In Force | Reference | Superseded | Deprecated`. Match the file's content honestly:
   - `Proposed` = the decision exists but hasn't been ratified or actioned
   - `Accepted` = founder has approved + work is underway/done
   - `In Force` = the decision is binding operational policy right now
   - `Reference` = factual recording (audits, inventories, manifests)
   - `Superseded` = a later artefact replaces this one
   - `Deprecated` = the decision is no longer applied

   REJECT if status is missing, conflicts with content (e.g., "Accepted" but Sub-decisions are "Proposed pending commercial conversations"), or is "Accepted" without a Founder decision date.

2. **Context section** — explains the problem before the solution. Should be readable cold; if a new reader can't tell what this decision is about from the Context alone, REJECT.

3. **Decision section** — names the choice, not the deliberation. If the artefact is mostly deliberation with no clear decision, REJECT.

4. **Alternatives considered** — for ADRs, at least 2 alternatives MUST be named + rejected with reasons. If only one option is presented, REJECT — that's a memo, not a decision document.

5. **Consequences section** — what changes downstream. Includes risk register implications, master brief edits authorised (if any), downstream-artefact updates required.

6. **Status update line at end** — current state ("Accepted on 2026-05-16 by founder + Claude Code") OR ratification-pending note.

## §2 — ADR-specific structure (for files matching `ADR-*.md`)

In addition to §1, ADRs MUST:

- Have a numbered identifier in the filename matching the contents ("ADR-003" in filename → "# ADR-003 —" as the H1)
- Be sequentially numbered (no gaps — ADR-001 → 002 → 003 → 004)
- Link to predecessor ADRs if extending or referring to them
- Have at least one "Decision" heading + at least one explicit "Decision 1 — <terse summary>" subheading per distinct decision

REJECT if any of these are missing.

---

## §3 — Citation accuracy (heavily-tested area)

Past audits found 15 fabricated `§10.4` references in one batch. Recurrence is likely. Check:

For every cited section reference (e.g., "master brief §6 Day 7 line 502"):

1. Open the cited file
2. Find the cited section
3. Verify the citation matches the content the artefact claims it does

If even one citation is wrong, REJECT with the specific citation listed. Past pattern: `master brief §10.4 cost target` cited 15 times; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list with no cost-target content.

For relative references ("per ADR-003 §3.3.3"), confirm the section exists in the predecessor.

For commit-SHA references (e.g., `c21fbfe`, `fec8872`), confirm the SHA matches the artefact's date + makes sense in context. Don't require running `git show` if the SHA is consistent with the narrative.

---

## §4 — Master brief edit authorisation

If the ADR authorises master brief edits (an "## Master brief edits authorised by this ADR" section):

1. The proposed text MUST be quoted verbatim — both current AND proposed.
2. The edit's line numbers MUST match the live master brief (sample-check at least one).
3. Edits MUST land in either (a) this commit, (b) the next atomic-correction commit, or (c) an explicit deferred queue. Vague "later" disposition = REJECT.
4. Risk #7 (master-brief-drift-accumulation) edit count MUST update if this ADR adds edits to the queue.

---

## §5 — Spec-gap surfacing

Reference design docs often surface spec gaps (`§N.M-A`, `§N.M-B` etc.). Each gap MUST:

- Be numbered uniquely within the design doc
- State the gap (what's missing in the upstream spec)
- Recommend a resolution OR be explicitly deferred to a named owner + week
- Not contradict each other (gap §2.1-A resolution must not break gap §2.1-B resolution)

REJECT if a gap is stated without a resolution path AND not explicitly deferred with owner + trigger.

---

## §6 — Implementation deviation acknowledgement

If the ADR ratifies deviations from a predecessor ADR (e.g., ADR-004 deviates from ADR-003):

1. Predecessor MUST be linked
2. Each deviation MUST be numbered + reasoned individually
3. Predecessor's text MUST be quoted to show what's being deviated from
4. Reason for deviation MUST be concrete (citing a boundary, a runtime constraint, a discovered bug — not "felt cleaner")
5. Rollback or alternative path MUST be named ("if rejected: build X shim instead")

REJECT if deviations are listed without quoting the predecessor or without concrete reasoning.

---

## §7 — Decision_log audit fields (master brief §8.1 Change 2)

Architecture decisions don't directly write to `decision_log` (the agent runtime does), but they MAY constrain what the runtime writes. Check:

- If the decision adds a `decision_log.phase` value: confirm Day-4 §6.3 schema CHECK constraint includes it (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff`)
- If the decision adds a new ESC code: confirm `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (Phase 1 of Day 8) has the code listed
- If the decision references `payload.tier` or `payload.<key>`: confirm autosend-safety-policy §7 documents the field shape
- If the decision restricts `agent_name` values: confirm sentinel names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`, `_shared`) are consistent with usage

REJECT if a decision adds an enum value or column to `decision_log` without confirming the schema supports it.

---

## §8 — Boundary-specific rejections for this artefact type

In addition to the four boundaries in `SKILL.md` §2:

- **Submodule reference** — decision docs MAY name cortextOS files for reference (e.g., `add-agent.ts:131-140`); they MUST NOT propose modifying them. If the ADR proposes a modification to `packages/harness/cortextos/*` outside the shadow points, REJECT.

- **Adapter boundary** — `Composio` and `AgentMail` may appear in INTERNAL discussion text (e.g., "we considered Composio") but MUST NOT appear in `tools.yaml` shape definitions, agent.md examples, or schema fixtures. If the ADR proposes including either in any of those locations, REJECT.

- **v1 source code** — `~/code/intel-force-os/` (the v1 codebase) MUST NOT be modified. ADRs MAY reference v1 for prior-art lessons; MUST NOT instruct edits.

---

## §9 — Common false-RATIFY traps to watch for

Past patterns that look RATIFIABLE but should REJECT:

- **"Trust me" architecture** — the artefact asserts a design works without alternatives weighed. Even simple decisions need at least one weighted alternative.

- **Over-elaborated worked examples** — a 200-line "Concierge worked example" inside an architecture decision is a red flag for masking a thin decision underneath. Skim the worked example; if the decision itself is < 50 lines, REJECT and demand more decision-content.

- **Status drift** — file says `Accepted` but content includes `TODO`, `pending`, `to be decided`. REJECT.

- **Hidden caveats** — major limitations buried at the bottom in a "Notes" section. Surface to the Decision or Consequences section. REJECT.

- **Cross-cite hallucination** — references "as documented in §X" but §X doesn't actually document it. Check.

- **Numbered options that omit the chosen one's reasoning** — "Options: A, B, C. Chose B." but no reasoning for WHY B. REJECT.

---

## §10 — When to RATIFY-with-notes

Use this sparingly. RATIFIED-with-notes is appropriate when:

- The artefact passes all required checks but has typos or wording suboptimalities
- A genuinely advisory observation worth surfacing but not blocking
- The author should fix-up at next touch but the merge is fine

Anything load-bearing — citation errors, spec gaps without resolution, status drift, boundary violations — is REJECTED, not RATIFIED-with-notes. If you find yourself adding more than 5 lines of notes, the artefact has structural issues and should be REJECTED.

---

## §11 — Quick checklist (run this for every ADR-type artefact)

- [ ] Has Status field with valid value matching content
- [ ] Has Context, Decision, Consequences sections
- [ ] (If ADR) Numbered + sequentially located + has alternatives weighed
- [ ] All citations verifiable (sample at least 3)
- [ ] No fabricated section references
- [ ] No submodule modifications proposed outside shadow points
- [ ] No Composio/AgentMail in `tools.yaml`/`agent.md` examples
- [ ] No v1-source modifications proposed
- [ ] Any master-brief edits include current+proposed text + line numbers + disposition
- [ ] Spec gaps (if any) have named resolution or deferred owner
- [ ] Status field matches content honesty (no Accepted-with-pending-sub-decisions unless explicitly noted)

If all clear: RATIFIED.
If any fail: REJECTED with numbered issues citing specifics.
