=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

---

*End of top-level SKILL.md. Apply the relevant type-specific skill next.*

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: schema-change ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-schema-change

Type-specific checks for: `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` + any v0.X supplement file (`vertical-schema.vN.M-supplement.yaml`).

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

---

## §1 — Schema layering invariant

IFOS vertical schemas layer above Day-4 §6.3 generic Postgres primitives:

```
entities (id, tenant_slug, entity_type, entity_id, data JSONB, version, ...)
entity_links (..., source_entity_type, source_entity_id, target_entity_type, target_entity_id, link_type, ...)
decision_log (..., agent_name, phase, payload JSONB, ...)
```

The vertical schema specifies (a) which `entity_type` slugs are valid, (b) what JSON shape `entities.data` takes per entity_type, (c) which `link_type` slugs are valid. **Schemas DO NOT create new Postgres tables in v0.X** — supplements that propose new tables (e.g., `voice_corpus`, `voice_corpus_chunks`, `tone_rule`, `recent_edit`) MUST be paired with explicit `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M-to-vN.M+1.sql` companion files OR explicitly mark the new tables as "auxiliary v0.X tables, not entities".

REJECT if a schema declares a new entity_type without naming whether it lives in `entities.data` JSONB OR in a new auxiliary table; the layering should be explicit.

---

## §2 — Per-entity required fields

Every entity_type definition MUST include:

- `description` — 1-2 sentence canonical definition in IFOS vocabulary
- `bullhorn_source` — exactly one of:
  - `Bullhorn.<Entity>` (with optional `where` clause)
  - `none (IFOS-derived from <source>)`
  - `none (IFOS-internal; not synced to ATS)`
- `v1_0_agent_access` — list of agents from master brief §8.2 with R / W / R+W disposition, OR explicit "none (v1.1+ exercise)"
- `canonical_fields` — at least 5 fields with type + required + source (Bullhorn path OR IFOS-derived)

REJECT if any of these are missing.

For each field within `canonical_fields`:

- `type` — one of `string | integer | number | boolean | array | object | timestamp | date`
- `required` — boolean
- `source` — `Bullhorn.<Entity>.<field>` OR `IFOS-derived` (with note on how)
- `notes` — optional but recommended for non-obvious fields

REJECT if any field lacks `type`, `required`, or `source`.

---

## §3 — JSON Schema compatibility (for entities.data shape)

Field types declared in the YAML must round-trip to valid JSON Schema. Cross-check against `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-*.json`:

- If a field's `type: array`, the YAML must imply item type (via `notes: Items: <type>`)
- If a field's `type: object`, the YAML must imply nested shape OR be explicitly free-form
- If a field references a `voice_classifier_score` or similar [0.0, 1.0] bounded value, confirm the migration SQL adds a CHECK constraint OR a trigger

REJECT if YAML field types cannot be expressed as JSON Schema for entities.data.

---

## §4 — Relationship definitions

`relationships:` (or `additional_relationships:` in supplements) defines `entity_links.link_type` values. Each MUST include:

- `source` — entity_type
- `target` — entity_type
- `cardinality` — `1:1 | 1:N | N:1 | M:N`
- `description` — 1-2 sentences
- `v1_0_exercise` — which agents use this link OR explicit "none (v1.1+)"

REJECT if cardinality is missing or contradicts the agent_access_matrix (e.g., cardinality says `1:N` from candidate → placement but matrix has both as R+W to placement, implying M:N).

Cross-referenced entities MUST exist in this schema OR a previous version (v0.1 for v0.2 supplement). REJECT if relationship references an undefined entity_type.

---

## §5 — Agent access matrix consistency

`agent_access_matrix:` must list every v1.0 agent (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge) + state R / W / R+W / none for every entity_type.

Cross-check:

- For each entity, the `v1_0_agent_access` field in §1 MUST match the matrix
- For each agent in the matrix, every entity from `entities:` MUST be present (no silent omissions)
- `Diagnostic` must have `none` or `R` for all entities — Diagnostic doesn't write to Bullhorn per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1
- `Janitor` must have R+W on `candidate` per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 A2
- `Scribe` must have R+W on `candidate` + `placement` per §4.1 A3
- `Concierge` must have R+W on `candidate` + `placement` per §4.1 A6

REJECT if matrix omits an agent, omits an entity, or contradicts the agent's specified bullhorn-integration role.

---

## §6 — Bullhorn mapping consistency

`bullhorn_mapping:` must align with `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §3 endpoint surface:

- Every entity with `bullhorn_source: Bullhorn.X` must have a mapping row in `bullhorn_mapping:`
- Field mappings (canonical IFOS field → Bullhorn field) must NOT contradict Bullhorn's actual API
- v1.0 endpoint surface is 4 entities (Candidate, ClientCorporation, JobOrder, Note + Placement extension). v0.X schemas with more `Bullhorn.X` sources than these need explicit deferral notes for v1.1+ entities.

REJECT if a `Bullhorn.X` source is named but no corresponding mapping row exists.

---

## §7 — Migration SQL pairing (for supplements that add entities)

Supplements (`vertical-schema.vN.M-supplement.yaml`) that add new entity_types MUST be paired with:

- `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M-to-vN.M+1.sql` (forward migration)
- `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M+1-to-vN.M.sql` (rollback)

The supplement MUST cite both file paths in a `migration:` section. REJECT if a supplement adds tables without naming the migration files.

If migration files exist, cross-check (don't deeply review — that's `review-postgres-migration` skill's job):

- Every new entity_type in the supplement → exactly one `CREATE TABLE` in the forward migration
- Every new field added to existing entities → either a JSONB key (preferred per Day-4 §6.3) OR a column ADD on `entities` (less common)
- The rollback SQL exists + is non-trivial (not just `-- TODO`)

REJECT if migration files are referenced but missing OR mismatch the supplement's declared additions.

---

## §8 — Open-question discipline

`open_questions:` (or `open_questions_vN.M_additions:` in supplements) entries MUST:

- Be numbered (Q1, Q2, ...) with no gaps
- State the question concretely (not "what should we do about X?" — instead "should X be A or B?")
- Name options (A / B / C with one-line descriptions)
- Have a `vN.M_default` (the default the schema currently encodes)
- Have a `trigger_for_revisit` (when do we revisit — named event/date, not "later")

REJECT if any question lacks options OR a default OR a trigger.

Sample-check: if the schema has 10+ open questions but most defaults are "TBD" or "founder decides during pilot", that's signal of insufficient design depth. REJECT and demand defaults.

---

## §9 — Voice corpus + voice score consistency (for v0.2 + later)

If the supplement defines voice_corpus / tone_rule / recent_edit (Phase 4 patterns):

- `voice_corpus` MUST have a `version` field (semver) + `is_active` boolean + at-most-one-active enforced (partial unique index in migration SQL)
- `voice_corpus` chunking_strategy enum must be exhaustive — listing only "paragraph" without "sentence-window-N" or "semantic-segment-vN" reserved is acceptable for v0.X but should name the reserved values
- `tone_rule.severity` must be `info | warn | block`; other values REJECT
- `tone_rule.applies_to_agents` — empty array = "all agents"; non-empty array = filter list. If the field allows null with different semantics, REJECT (ambiguity)
- `recent_edit` MUST be append-only in migration GRANTs (SELECT + INSERT only on `ifos_app` role)
- `recent_edit.resolution` must be exhaustive: `approved_verbatim | approved_after_edit | rejected | deferred`
- `voice_classifier_score` fields on entities must be `[0.0, 1.0]` bounded — REJECT if no CHECK constraint or trigger is named in migration

---

## §10 — Common false-RATIFY traps to watch for

- **Missing required field on entity** — `candidate.bullhorn_id` MUST be `required: true` (it's the round-trip primary key). If marked `false`, REJECT.

- **Inconsistent required + nullable** — `required: true` with a `notes: May be nullable for...` is contradictory. REJECT.

- **Source mismatch** — `source: Bullhorn.Candidate.email` on a field marked `IFOS-derived` is incoherent. REJECT.

- **PII flagging missing** — fields holding email/phone/name should have a `notes:` line referencing `autosend-safety-policy §7 payload_preview PII rules`. Not blocking on absence but flag in RATIFIED-with-notes.

- **Schema-validates-itself-fail** — try to mentally construct an `entities.data` JSON for the candidate entity using the schema's required fields. If you can't construct a valid example, REJECT.

---

## §11 — Quick checklist

- [ ] Status field present + matches content
- [ ] Layering invariant stated (entities/entity_links/decision_log primitives + JSONB shape OR new auxiliary tables)
- [ ] Every entity has description + bullhorn_source + v1_0_agent_access + canonical_fields (≥5 fields)
- [ ] Every field has type + required + source
- [ ] All relationships have source + target + cardinality
- [ ] Agent access matrix lists all 6 v1.0 agents × all entities
- [ ] Bullhorn mapping matches `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §3 surface
- [ ] Migration SQL files exist + are referenced (if supplement adds entities)
- [ ] Open questions all have options + default + trigger
- [ ] (For v0.2+) voice corpus + tone_rule + recent_edit invariants checked
- [ ] No PII fields without privacy notes (advisory only)

If all clear: RATIFIED.
If any fail: REJECTED with numbered issues citing specifics.

# §6 — Migration sequencing (JSONB validation, not ALTER TABLE)
# ============================================================================

migration_sequence:
  forward: migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql
  rollback: migrations/v0.3-to-v0.2.sql

  pre_conditions:
    - v0.2 migration applied (voice_corpus + tone_rule + recent_edit tables exist)
    - validate_voice_scores trigger active on entities table
    - RLS + ifos_app grants from Day-4 §6.3 in place
    - migration-test tenant row exists in tenants table

  steps:
    1: |
      Verify v0.2 prerequisites (DO block in migration §1).
    2: |
      CREATE TABLE cash_conductor_transactions with RLS isolation policy +
      ifos_app grants + 2 indexes (migration §2).
    3: |
      CREATE TABLE cash_conductor_invoices with RLS + grants + 3 indexes
      (migration §3).
    4: |
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_entities_data_v0_3() — replaces
      the v0.2 validate_voice_scores binding while forwarding v0.2 voice-
      score checks. Adds JSONB key validations for 14 v0.3 fields across
      candidate / contact / brief / placement / opportunity entity_types.
      Re-attaches the trigger to entities table (migration §4).
      NOTE: entities table itself is unchanged; entity.data is JSONB and
      v0.3 keys are validated by the trigger, not via ALTER TABLE.
    5: |
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3() —
      hard-fails on unknown config keys (Rule 2); type-validates the 4 new
      v0.3 keys. Trigger attached to tenant_adapters table (migration §5).
    6: |
      Smoke verification DO block confirms both cash_conductor_*
      tables exist (migration §6).
    7: |
      COMMIT; or ROLLBACK on any error.

  post_migration_steps:
    1: Run scripts/run-tenancy-audit.sh; expect 12/12 invariants pass (T1-T12)
    2: Update agent.md files (Scribe + Janitor + Cash Conductor + Concierge)
       to cite v0.3 supplement instead of "v0.3-supplement-pending"
    3: Re-run Codex review-agent-bundle on the 4 agent.md files; expect
       Cat-β findings closed

# ============================================================================
# §8 — Open questions (structured per review-schema-change §8)
# ============================================================================

open_questions:

  Q1_employment_type_enum_completeness:
    question: Are 6 employment_type enum values sufficient for UK recruitment?
    options:
      A: |
        Keep 6 values as in §1.candidate.employment_type — perm, contract,
        contract_inside_ir35, contract_outside_ir35, day_rate, hybrid.
      B: |
        Add 3 more — fixed_term_employee, apprenticeship, contract_for_services.
      C: |
        Per-tenant overrides via tenant_adapters.config.employment_type_extensions
        (array of allowed strings); validate at write time against tenant's list.
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First pilot tenant onboarding; if pilot uses any value
      outside A, escalate to B or C.

  Q2_key_skills_max_length:
    question: Cap at 20 items per candidate adequate?
    options:
      A: Keep cap at 20 (validator hard-fails over).
      B: Increase to 50 (handles senior technical candidates with deep stacks).
      C: Remove cap entirely (rely on application-layer pruning).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot data after 30+ candidates indexed; if >5%
      of candidates hit the 20-item cap, escalate to B.

  Q3_placement_status_enum_lifecycle:
    question: 6-state placement_status enum maps to Bullhorn's native state machine?
    options:
      A: Maintain 6 states; manually map at Janitor dedup time (Bullhorn → IFOS).
      B: Add Bullhorn-native states verbatim to the enum (likely 8-10 more).
      C: Add a mapping table (auxiliary) — placement_status_mapping with
         (bullhorn_state TEXT, ifos_state TEXT, tenant_slug TEXT).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot Bullhorn schema audit at onboarding;
      escalate to B or C if 1:1 mapping breaks.

  Q4_cash_conductor_transactions_retention:
    question: Bank-feed transactions contain PII (payee_name_raw + description).
      What's the production retention policy?
    options:
      A: 7-year retention with automated pseudonymization at year 7 (hash
         payee_name_raw + description; preserve amount + dates for audit).
      B: Indefinite with pseudonymization at year 7 (same as A but matched
         rows retained beyond 7 years for cross-period reconciliation).
      C: Per-tenant retention override in tenant_adapters.config.
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot DPA review (founder + legal); if pilot
      tenant requires shorter retention, escalate to C with tenant-specific
      override. Pseudonymization implementation lands in W4-polish slice.
    production_use_gating: |
      Until pseudonymization implementation lands, production use of
      cash_conductor_transactions table is GATED by an explicit per-tenant
      DPA addendum signed by founder + tenant. Migration-test tenant data
      is not subject to this gate.

  Q5_unknown_config_keys_handling:
    question: validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3 trigger behavior on unknown keys?
    options:
      A: Hard-fail (CURRENT v0.3 behavior per migration §5; Rule 2 Schema-before-code).
      B: Warn-and-store-anyway (permissive; allows forward-compatible additions).
      C: Per-tenant override (tenant-admin can flip behavior for their tenant).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: If v1.1 tenant-config experimentation surfaces need
      for forward-compat, escalate to B or C with explicit ADR.

# ============================================================================
# §9 — Why v0.3 is the right unblock
# ============================================================================

rationale: |
  Round-8 categorization (disagreement doc Phase 4 Cat-β) identified that
  4-of-5 remaining agent.md scaffolds (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor,
  Concierge) cannot re-ratify until referenced schema fields exist. v0.3
  adds 14 entity JSONB keys + 2 auxiliary tables + 4 config keys + 1
  payload extension, closing those findings.

  After v0.3 ratifies + migration applies:
    - Scribe agent.md §3 entity-field table becomes PARTIALLY schema-verifiable:
      the v0.3-added fields (employment_type, key_skills, preferred_channel,
      next_action_target_date, must_haves, nice_to_haves, deal_breakers,
      placement_status, week_1_status_note, satisfaction_signal,
      headcount_growth_signal_text, hiring_velocity_band, decision_window_text)
      are now schema-backed. The Scribe §3 narrative still references SOME
      fields outside v0.3 scope (current_role_title vs v0.1 current_role;
      seniority — not yet in schema; brief.start_date should be
      start_date_target; opportunity.sector — not yet in schema). These
      residual gaps are tracked in W4-polish-schema-extension backlog;
      they do not block v0.3 ratification but do require a Scribe agent.md
      consistency-pass before Scribe ratifies.
    - Janitor candidate.linkedin_url + recent_edit/tone_rule access valid
    - Cash Conductor agent.md §4 Postgres-tables claim schema-backed
    - Concierge tenant_adapters.config field refs valid
    - Diagnostic Tier 2 schema substrate exists (ADR-006 W4-polish prereq)

  Expected re-ratification: 1 Codex round per agent.md after v0.3 lands;
  ~3-5 residual mechanical findings per agent (down from current 4-6) —
  those are per-agent specifics (workflow, validate.sh/cycle.sh build slices),
  not schema gaps.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:205:        notes: v0.1 free-text. v1.1 entity-promotion candidate if Concierge surfaces shared-umbrella-company queries.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:214:        notes: When contractor's current placement ends; Concierge schedules follow-up communications around this date.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:216:      - IR35 classification is regulatory-bearing; v0.1 captures the field but T4 IR35 agent (v2.0 per master brief §9) is the canonical reasoner.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:217:      - Contractor lifecycle differs from candidate — relevant to Concierge nurture cadence per Product Spec §2.2 R7 (week-1 check-in for permanent; weekly check-in for contractor through engagement).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:226:      - Janitor (R+W — orphan-link sweep + normalisation per bullhorn §4.1 A2)

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:256:        notes: UK statutory identifier; key for Diagnostic agent's public-footprint enrichment per Ultraplan §8.1 A1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:261:        source: IFOS-derived (Janitor maintains)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:279:      - Client is read-heavy for v1.0 agents (Sourcing Scout context, Concierge relationship state); write access is Janitor-only.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:280:      - Companies House enrichment is Diagnostic agent's domain; the field is set by Diagnostic at first-pass.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:288:      - Concierge (R — decision-maker context per bullhorn §4.1 A6; thin in v1.0)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:289:      - (v1.1+) Inbound Triage — R+W expansion per master brief §9
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:321:        notes: v0.1 is essentially a tag for Concierge addressee-resolution gating; v1.1 Triage agent owns expansion (sub-fields for decision-domain, budget authority, etc.).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:334:        source: IFOS-derived (Concierge addressee-resolution gate per bullhorn §4.1 A6)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:337:      - v1.0 is intentionally thin — only the fields Concierge addressee-resolution needs for orange-tier sends.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:347:      - Janitor (R — status drift sweep per bullhorn §4.1 A2)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:348:      - Scribe (R — write-context resolution per bullhorn §4.1 A3)

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:410:        source: IFOS-derived (Concierge maintains based on client check-in cadence)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:425:      - Brief is the most-read entity by Sourcing Scout (matches against candidates) and Concierge (lifecycle communications reference active brief). Janitor sweeps for status drift.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:434:      - Janitor (R — sweep for stale/orphan placements per bullhorn §4.1 A2)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:435:      - Scribe (R+W — note links per bullhorn §4.1 A3)

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:481:        notes: Drives Concierge nurture-event firing.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:492:      - Lifecycle_stage drives Concierge's most-frequent autosend action (orange-tier `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` per autosend-policy §3 canonical orange).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:537:      A contractor's weekly hours record. v2.0 entity — exercised by T2 Timesheet agent + T6 Pay & Bill agent per master brief §9. v0.1 captures placeholder shape only.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:592:    v1_0_exercise: Janitor + Concierge use this link extensively for candidate placement history.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:599:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge reads to anchor lifecycle communications; Scribe reads for write-context resolution.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:615:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge reads for addressee-resolution per bullhorn §4.1 A6 Voice gate; addressee = primary decision-maker contact.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:623:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge addressee context.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:630:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge reads for outbound-message addressee correctness; thin in v1.0.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:637:    v1_0_exercise: Sourcing Scout captures at first-touch when relevant; not heavily exercised in v1.0.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:671:  Diagnostic:

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:736:# Verifies against real Bullhorn data at Week 3-4 Janitor build per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:745:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 18 fields; full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:751:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 10 fields (candidate-overlap subset + IR35 contractor-specific fields); full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:757:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 11 fields; full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:758:    notes: Companies House number is IFOS-derived from Diagnostic enrichment, not Bullhorn-sourced.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:763:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 10 fields; full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A. v1.1 Triage expands contact-side coverage.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:768:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 17 fields; full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A. Note Bullhorn customText1-25 fields are tenant-specific and require per-tenant adapter mapping not standard schema work.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:774:    field_mapping_density: v0.1 covers 11 fields; full Bullhorn field-density TBD pending Week 3-4 Janitor verification per bullhorn §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:775:    notes: lifecycle_stage is IFOS-derived (Concierge maintains); Bullhorn does not natively store IFOS's nurture-cadence stages.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:805:    revisit_trigger: If Janitor build at Week 3-4 needs per-note structured querying (e.g., "all notes Concierge wrote about candidate X in last 90 days"), promote Note to entity_type='note' in v1.1; adapter layer handles migration.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:811:    revisit_trigger: Janitor build at Week 3-4 verifies against real Bullhorn data per bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.1 Spec gap §4.1-A and surfaces full required set.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:816:    decision: System agent names like `_renderer` are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only, with `phase` from the live 5-value enum (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff` per Day-4 §6.3 + Day-5 migration). The sentinel `_renderer` writes `phase='gating_failed'` for failures and `phase='action'` for successful renders per ADR-004 Decision 7.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:822:    revisit_trigger: v1.1 Inbound Triage agent build per master brief §9 expands decision-authority modelling.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:829:    rationale: T2 + T6 builds are v2.0 per master brief §9; full schema requires pay/bill modelling not yet designed.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:835:    revisit_trigger: If Concierge surfaces multi-contractor patterns where the same umbrella company serves multiple IFOS-tracked contractors (e.g., "all contractors at Acme Umbrella who terminate placements within 90 days"), promote umbrella_company to entity_type='umbrella_company' in v1.1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:841:    revisit_trigger: Skill-matching accuracy from Sourcing Scout's first 4 tenant-weeks of operation; if free-text matching produces <60% precision, canonical skill taxonomy lands as v1.1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:856:    rationale: v1.0 Concierge addressee-resolution uses primary-decision-maker; panel modelling adds value when v1.1 Triage handles inbound brief queries from multiple stakeholders.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:862:    revisit_trigger: Any Product Spec revision touching R7 nurture cadence (e.g., adding week_2 checkpoint, removing month_24, splitting month_12 into quarterly checkpoints) requires schema migration. Migration steps — (1) ALTER TABLE add new enum value(s) to entities.data JSONB validator; (2) backfill existing placement rows if semantic change (e.g., week_1 → week_1_check_in renaming); (3) Concierge nurture-event firing logic updated to match new cadence.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:870:      canonical_fields.<name>.source values are free-text strings in v0.1. Two patterns used: (a) entity.field paths like `Bullhorn.Candidate.firstName`; (b) free-text with citation like `IFOS-derived (Scribe extracts from call transcripts per bullhorn §4.1 A3)`.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:890:    expected_date: post Week 3-4 (after Janitor build verifies against real Bullhorn data)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:892:      Codex-ratified version. Field sets expanded per Janitor's real-Bullhorn-data findings (Q3 trigger). Possibly Note entity promoted to entity_type if Janitor surfaces query patterns (Q2 trigger). 2-3 revisions expected from v0.1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:896:    expected_date: post first-pilot operations (Q4 2026 if pilot lands per master brief §6 Day 7 question 1)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:901:    expected_date: 2027+ per master brief §9 build sequence

   592	
   593	  Q1_employment_type_enum_completeness:
   594	    question: Are 6 employment_type enum values sufficient for UK recruitment?
   595	    options:
   596	      A: |
   597	        Keep 6 values as in §1.candidate.employment_type — perm, contract,
   598	        contract_inside_ir35, contract_outside_ir35, day_rate, hybrid.
   599	      B: |
   600	        Add 3 more — fixed_term_employee, apprenticeship, contract_for_services.
   601	      C: |
   602	        Per-tenant overrides via tenant_adapters.config.employment_type_extensions
   603	        (array of allowed strings); validate at write time against tenant's list.
   604	    v0_3_default: A
   605	    trigger_for_revisit: First pilot tenant onboarding; if pilot uses any value
   606	      outside A, escalate to B or C.
   607	
   608	  Q2_key_skills_max_length:
   609	    question: Cap at 20 items per candidate adequate?
   610	    options:
   611	      A: Keep cap at 20 (validator hard-fails over).
   612	      B: Increase to 50 (handles senior technical candidates with deep stacks).
   613	      C: Remove cap entirely (rely on application-layer pruning).
   614	    v0_3_default: A
   615	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot data after 30+ candidates indexed; if >5%
   616	      of candidates hit the 20-item cap, escalate to B.
   617	
   618	  Q3_placement_status_enum_lifecycle:
   619	    question: 6-state placement_status enum maps to Bullhorn's native state machine?
   620	    options:
   621	      A: Maintain 6 states; manually map at Janitor dedup time (Bullhorn → IFOS).
   622	      B: Add Bullhorn-native states verbatim to the enum (likely 8-10 more).
   623	      C: Add a mapping table (auxiliary) — placement_status_mapping with
   624	         (bullhorn_state TEXT, ifos_state TEXT, tenant_slug TEXT).
   625	    v0_3_default: A
   626	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot Bullhorn schema audit at onboarding;
   627	      escalate to B or C if 1:1 mapping breaks.
   628	
   629	  Q4_cash_conductor_transactions_retention:
   630	    question: Bank-feed transactions contain PII (payee_name_raw + description).
   631	      What's the production retention policy?
   632	    options:
   633	      A: 7-year retention with automated pseudonymization at year 7 (hash
   634	         payee_name_raw + description; preserve amount + dates for audit).
   635	      B: Indefinite with pseudonymization at year 7 (same as A but matched
   636	         rows retained beyond 7 years for cross-period reconciliation).
   637	      C: Per-tenant retention override in tenant_adapters.config.
   638	    v0_3_default: A
   639	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot DPA review (founder + legal); if pilot
   640	      tenant requires shorter retention, escalate to C with tenant-specific
   641	      override. Pseudonymization implementation lands in W4-polish slice.
   642	    production_use_gating: |
   643	      Until pseudonymization implementation lands, production use of
   644	      cash_conductor_transactions table is GATED by an explicit per-tenant
   645	      DPA addendum signed by founder + tenant. Migration-test tenant data
   646	      is not subject to this gate.
   647	
   648	  Q5_unknown_config_keys_handling:
   649	    question: validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3 trigger behavior on unknown keys?
   650	    options:
   651	      A: Hard-fail (CURRENT v0.3 behavior per migration §5; Rule 2 Schema-before-code).
   652	      B: Warn-and-store-anyway (permissive; allows forward-compatible additions).
   653	      C: Per-tenant override (tenant-admin can flip behavior for their tenant).
   654	    v0_3_default: A
   655	    trigger_for_revisit: If v1.1 tenant-config experimentation surfaces need
   656	      for forward-compat, escalate to B or C with explicit ADR.

   662	rationale: |
   663	  Round-8 categorization (disagreement doc Phase 4 Cat-β) identified that
   664	  4-of-5 remaining agent.md scaffolds (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor,
   665	  Concierge) cannot re-ratify until referenced schema fields exist. v0.3
   666	  adds 14 entity JSONB keys + 2 auxiliary tables + 4 config keys + 1
   667	  payload extension, closing those findings.
   668	
   669	  After v0.3 ratifies + migration applies:
   670	    - Scribe agent.md §3 entity-field table becomes PARTIALLY schema-verifiable:
   671	      the v0.3-added fields (employment_type, key_skills, preferred_channel,
   672	      next_action_target_date, must_haves, nice_to_haves, deal_breakers,
   673	      placement_status, week_1_status_note, satisfaction_signal,
   674	      headcount_growth_signal_text, hiring_velocity_band, decision_window_text)
   675	      are now schema-backed. The Scribe §3 narrative still references SOME
   676	      fields outside v0.3 scope (current_role_title vs v0.1 current_role;
   677	      seniority — not yet in schema; brief.start_date should be
   678	      start_date_target; opportunity.sector — not yet in schema). These
   679	      residual gaps are tracked in W4-polish-schema-extension backlog;
   680	      they do not block v0.3 ratification but do require a Scribe agent.md
   681	      consistency-pass before Scribe ratifies.
   682	    - Janitor candidate.linkedin_url + recent_edit/tone_rule access valid
   683	    - Cash Conductor agent.md §4 Postgres-tables claim schema-backed
   684	    - Concierge tenant_adapters.config field refs valid
   685	    - Diagnostic Tier 2 schema substrate exists (ADR-006 W4-polish prereq)
   686	
   687	  Expected re-ratification: 1 Codex round per agent.md after v0.3 lands;
   688	  ~3-5 residual mechanical findings per agent (down from current 4-6) —
   689	  those are per-agent specifics (workflow, validate.sh/cycle.sh build slices),
   690	  not schema gaps.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:26:  - cortextOS substrate entities (PM2 process records, file-bus messages, approval gate entries) are NOT modelled here. They live in cortextOS's own state per master brief §2.4.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:218:      - Adapter layer responsibility: if Bullhorn.Candidate.status changes to/from 'contractor', adapter materialises both entity_type rows in entities table with appropriate entity_links for placement continuity.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:574:# §2 — Relationship definitions (entity_links.link_type values)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:614:      v0.1 captures the PRIMARY decision-maker only. Real-world recruiting often has multiple decision-makers per brief (hiring manager + HR + occasionally CTO/CFO/CEO). The N:1 cardinality is the simplifying v0.1 assumption. Multi-decision-maker panels deferred to v1.1 Triage per Q10 — when v1.1 lands, brief_decision_maker may flip to M:N with role-in-panel metadata (chair, technical-evaluator, hr-lead, budget-approver, etc.) on entity_links.metadata.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:804:    v0_1_decision: Bullhorn Notes ingest into `decision_log.payload` with `payload.note_content`, `payload.bullhorn_note_id`, `payload.note_external_visibility` (boolean). Not a top-level entity_type in v0.1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:806:    rationale: Notes operationally ARE the audit trail (autosend-policy.md §7 confirms); decision_log has RLS + tier metadata + payload_hash for audit; avoid dual-storage problem at v1.0; cheap to promote later if needed.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:816:    decision: System agent names like `_renderer` are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only, with `phase` from the live 5-value enum (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff` per Day-4 §6.3 + Day-5 migration). The sentinel `_renderer` writes `phase='gating_failed'` for failures and `phase='action'` for successful renders per ADR-004 Decision 7.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:817:    rationale: Vertical schema covers tenant-domain entities only. System-internal agents (renderer, validators, ingest pipeline) live in decision_log audit but are not first-class business entities.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:120:      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:151:          Enum: ["info", "warn", "block"]. `info` is observational (logged, not enforced); `warn` shows up in decision_log without blocking; `block` is a Gate-A hard-fail (causes regenerate-with-feedback per Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget).

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:24:- **Tenant-data tables** (9 in v0.2): `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`, `tenant_eval_sets`, `tenant_adapters`, `voice_corpus`, `voice_corpus_chunks`, `tone_rule`, `recent_edit`. All have `tenant_slug` column + RLS policy.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:37:- **Documentation source:** Day-4 §6.3 lines 708-797 (5 tables) + v0.2 §2-§5 (4 tables).

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:52:- **Documentation source:** Day-4 §6.3 lines 932-936 + v0.2 §2-§5 (4 ALTER TABLE statements).
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:63:- **Definition:** RLS policy named `<table>_tenant_isolation` (or `tenant_isolation` for Day-4 tables) attached to every tenant-data table, using `current_setting('app.current_tenant', TRUE)` as the predicate.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:86:### T5 — `ifos_app` role has no DELETE on `decision_log` or `recent_edit` (append-only audit tables)
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:88:- **Definition:** The two audit tables (`decision_log` from Day-4 + `recent_edit` from v0.2) are structurally append-only. Even if app code attempted DELETE, the role lacks permission.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:90:- **Documentation source:** Day-4 §6.3 line 764 (`GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON decision_log TO ifos_app`) + v0.2 §6 line 172 (`GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON recent_edit TO ifos_app`).
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:94:  WHERE grantee='ifos_app' AND table_name IN ('decision_log','recent_edit')
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:97:  Expected: 4 rows total — `decision_log` × {SELECT, INSERT}, `recent_edit` × {SELECT, INSERT}. No UPDATE or DELETE.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:103:- **Enforcement:** Provisioning script (`scripts/provision-tenant.sh`, currently scattered in Day-4 §6.5) creates dirs with `chmod 700`. Renderer (`packages/agent-renderer/src/renderer.ts`) never writes symlinks into vault. The only symlink IFOS creates is at `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<tenant>/agents/<agent>/.claude/hooks/_shared → ../../../_shared/` (Decision 2 of ADR-004) — that's the org-agents dir, NOT vault.

Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.

docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:119:The `entities` table per `second-brain-design.md` §2.4.2 currently has `created_at` and `updated_at` columns. **Adding a `version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column is required** for optimistic concurrency. This surfaces as a new Day-4 Postgres provisioning tightening — see §7 Bucket 3.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:192:- If second attempt also fails: raise `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`, record in `decision_log` with `phase='gating_failed'` per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A enum extension, log human-readable error to operator Telegram per primitive 5 escalation surface.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:265:**Substrate:** discover all entities that reference the target via `entity_links` table per `second-brain-design.md` §2.4.2; iterate in deadlock-safe order; apply the rewrite under per-entity flock per §2; update `entity_links` rows in a single Postgres transaction per ADR-002 Decision 3.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:308:     FROM entity_links
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:319:  // 3. Postgres transaction: update entity_links table + entities table version
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:329:    // Update all entity_links rows that pointed at the old name
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:331:      `UPDATE entity_links SET to_entity_id = $1
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:381:**V1.0 mitigation:** surface partial failure as `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_PARTIAL_FAILURE` carrying the list of `failures` (referencing entities whose markdown bodies were not rewritten). Record in `decision_log` with `phase='gating_failed'`, `metadata` containing the failures list. **Founder reviews and manually reconciles** — for each failure, run the rewrite by hand (most edits are small) or accept temporary inconsistency until next operation through that entity.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:391:**V1.2+ improvement deferred** — async cascade with eventual consistency: rename completes synchronously at the Postgres + target-file layer; cascade-rewrite is queued as background tasks; consumers see the updated `entity_links` table immediately, and lagging markdown bodies are reconciled within minutes. Reduces user-visible rename latency. Out of v1.0 scope.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:406:| `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_PARTIAL_FAILURE` | §5: rewrite-backlinks cascade completed but ≥1 referencing entity failed to rewrite | `gating_failed` | Telegram operator chat, plus `failures` list in decision_log metadata |
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:409:All five route via `hh_decision_log` from master brief §8.1 Change 2 + `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` pattern from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.1. **All 5 codes catalogued + wired as of Day 8 2026-05-20** at `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` §2.2 (commit `a279226`) and `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh::autosend_escalate` (commit `e6e9df1`). Test coverage in `agents/_shared/tests/test-hook-helpers.sh`.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:424:| Cascade atomicity gap (v1.0 mitigation via `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_PARTIAL_FAILURE` + decision_log + manual reconciliation; full atomicity via write-ahead-log deferred to v1.2+) | §5.4 |
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:441:The `entities.version` column is a new Day-4 tightening — joins the three already on the list per `sequencing-target.md` §6.5 (entity_graph split + `_secrets.env` + `decision_log.phase` enum extension). Day-4 task now has **4 consolidated tightenings**.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:64:None of these are `MEMORY.md`. None is a "daily memory file." The IFOS pattern uses Postgres `decision_log` rows (`hh_decision_trigger / output / action` per master brief §8.1 Change 2) for the equivalent of "what did this agent do" persistence, and the per-tenant vault (master brief §5.1) for narrative content.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:167:├── _decisions/                                     ← narrative summaries — spec gap 2.1-B re: overlap with Postgres decision_log
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:416:The `decision_log` finding from Q1.4 is load-bearing here: every write operation triggers `hh_decision_*` calls per master brief §8.1 Change 2 (lines 170-173). The `entity-history` operation reads from the Postgres `decision_log` table, **not** from a separate per-entity history file. This is why the master brief's `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 is a spec gap (2.1-B) — there are two candidates for "where history lives" and only one of them is in the master brief.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:433:| `entity-history` | any agent v1.1: "what changed about this Candidate over time" | v1.1 (read) — but **writes are v1.0** | `(id: str, tenant_id: str)` | `List[DecisionLogEntry]` | few seconds | Sources from Postgres `decision_log` table (Ultraplan §5.1 line 227), NOT a separate history file. v1.0 agents write decision_log rows via `hh_decision_*` (master brief §8.1 Change 2); the read API is v1.1 |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:463:Three tables anchored in Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 ("`tenants`, `entity_graph`, `decision_log`"). The IFOS design here renames `entity_graph` to **`entities`** (one row per entity) and adds **`entity_links`** (the adjacency table) — both flagged below as **Spec gap 2.4-B** because Ultraplan groups them under a single name.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:538:**Source of truth:** filesystem markdown is canonical for the link presence; Postgres `entity_links` is the index. Resolution (display_name → id) is the IFOS-specific value-add — without it, `[[Sarah Bowen]]` is just a string.

This is the **only** source of entity-history queries — the `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 is for narrative summaries (Spec gap 2.1-B remains; recommended resolution: `_decisions/` is for founder-written end-of-quarter narratives only, not for agent decisions; agent decisions live exclusively in `decision_log`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:569:**Spec gap 2.4-B:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 groups entity index + adjacency under "`entity_graph`". This design splits them into `entities` + `entity_links` for clearer indexing semantics. **Recommended resolution:** adopt the split; update master brief §3.3 or Ultraplan §5.1 to reflect the two-table model. Codex-ratifiable on Day 7 by reading this section.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:571:**No `agent_runs` table for v1.0.** The `agent_run_id` column on `decision_log` is the join key; "what did this agent do this run" is a `SELECT * FROM decision_log WHERE agent_run_id = ...`. A separate `agent_runs` table can be derived as a materialised view if v1.1 dashboards need it.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:674:| `search-by-relationship` | Postgres `entity_links` reverse lookup by `to_id` (or forward by `from_id`) | None — if Postgres is down, this operation fails loudly rather than falling back | One-hop only in v1.0. The Postgres-only choice is deliberate: filesystem grep over frontmatter `linked_entities` arrays would be slow and brittle. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:676:| `ingest-entity` | Filesystem write (atomic) + Postgres UPSERT to `entities` + Postgres INSERTs to `entity_links` (all in one transaction per §2.6.1) | None — atomic or fail | Slug collision check via Postgres `SELECT 1 FROM entities WHERE tenant_slug = ? AND id = ?`. `hh_decision_trigger` + `hh_decision_output` calls insert to `decision_log` in the same transaction. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:677:| `update-entity` | Filesystem read-modify-write (under `flock`) + Postgres UPDATE `entities` + diff-driven update to `entity_links` | None — atomic or fail | Targets `<!-- BEGIN auto:{section} -->` block; preserves frontmatter outside the targeted field set. If `display_name` changed, triggers `rewrite-backlinks` (§2.6.3). |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:681:| `backlinks` | Postgres `entity_links` reverse lookup (`entity_links_backlinks_idx` on `(tenant_slug, to_id)`) | Filesystem grep of `wiki/compiled/**/*.md` body for `[[Display Name]]` | Fallback exists because the Postgres index is *derived* from filesystem; if Postgres is missing rows, filesystem is authoritative. v1.1 Brain UI panel. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:682:| `entity-history` | Postgres `decision_log` SELECT by `(tenant_slug, entity_id)` ORDER BY `created_at DESC` | None | v1.1 read; v1.0 writes via `hh_decision_*`. No filesystem fallback — decision_log is unique source. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:686:**Special attention to `backlinks`:** Postgres `entity_links` is primary, filesystem grep is the fallback. The fallback exists because wiki-links live in the markdown source; if Postgres is rebuilt from scratch (disaster recovery), the rebuild walks the filesystem and repopulates `entity_links`. The fallback is not a hot path — it runs at DR or at periodic reconciliation.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:712:- No corruption; both changes land; decision_log captures both `hh_decision_output` rows separately.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:725:4. **No follow-rename collision** — agents do not use Obsidian's built-in rename feature (we don't have a UI). Rename happens via `update-entity` with a new `display_name`, which triggers `rewrite-backlinks` (§2.6.3). If the human renames a file in Obsidian during this window, the file-path-changes mid-cascade — the cascade detects the rename via the next-scan inotify event and aborts with `ESC_VAULT_RENAME_RACE` (new code), surfacing to the operator.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:729:#### 2.6.3 rewrite-backlinks cascade
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:735:1. Postgres `entity_links` UPDATE sets `to_display_name = new_name WHERE to_id = $1` in one statement (transactional, atomic per the DB).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:736:2. A list of affected files is materialised: `SELECT DISTINCT file_path FROM entities e JOIN entity_links l ON e.id = l.from_id WHERE l.to_id = $1`.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:743:- Postgres `entity_links` flips immediately (within ms).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:782:**Decision-log volume:** every agent run produces 1-3 `decision_log` rows (`hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, optionally `hh_decision_action` when human responds). At 6 v1.0 agents × ~10 runs/agent/day × 3 tenants × 3 rows = ~540 rows/day per shared Postgres instance. Trivial volume; the table needs hash partitioning (per Ultraplan §5.1) primarily for query performance at v1.2+ scale, not v1.0 write throughput.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:870:Concurrency mechanisms live inside the server process. Audit logging via decision_log + an internal request log. Tenant scoping validated at server entry: the `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` from the agent's environment is the authoritative tenant; any tool call carrying a mismatched `tenant_slug` is rejected before reaching the library.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:889:| **Audit-loggability** — every read/write reaches `decision_log` + Codex review (master brief §8.1 + §10.5) | Each wrapper's CLI handler calls `hh_decision_trigger` / `hh_decision_output` directly before returning. Same pattern as cortextOS's 47 bus wrappers (e.g. `bus/send-message.sh` writes via `bus/message.ts`). One audit-log call site per op. | Server-internal request logger writes one row per tool invocation. Centralised — one log site for all 12 ops. But the log site lives in a separate process; correlation with the agent's `agent_run_id` requires passing it on every tool call. | Library writes audit row when called. Same library code as α/β, just invoked from a skill-instigated `node -e` or wrapper. Audit-log correctness depends on the skill documentation reminding the agent to pass `agent_run_id` — fragile. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:921:- **v2.0 LoRA scale (master brief §5.5):** the LoRA pipeline operates on the `decision_log` table, not on the wiki. Wiki ops from LoRA-enhanced agents are unchanged. Both options work.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:32:- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:40:**Week 3 needs a starting agent.** The renderer (ADR-003) lands Week 1-2; `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` land Week 1-2; Postgres `decision_log` lands Day 4 Week 0. By Week 3 the substrate is live and waiting for its first user. Without §A (first agent), Week 3 doesn't have a build target.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:55:| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:98:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:101:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **High** | Runnable from end of Week 2 with renderer + `_shared/` + Postgres decision_log. No vault `_secrets.env` complexity (no per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth needed), no wiki API needed. Single-tenant deployable immediately |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:110:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:348:2. **First production run lands clean** for at least one tenant — no `ESC_*` escalation rows in `decision_log` for agent N's run.

Schema migration is a one-line `CHECK` constraint update.

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:21:**Actions inside the internal data layer are not governed by this policy** (they are governed by RLS + the master brief §3.3 vault/Postgres split + the decision_log append-only enforcement).

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:55:Side effects allowed. The action proceeds immediately. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='yellow'` is written. Additionally, a sampling check fires (1-in-N per `action_type`; default N=10). On sampling, the action is enqueued for **human spot-check review** by the tenant operator within 24 hours of execution. Spot-check disagreement triggers retrospective review of the policy tier classification (potential tier elevation via tenant override).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:61:Side effects blocked at agent layer. The agent halts at `hh_decision_action` invocation. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='orange'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` fires (see §5). The cortextOS approval gate (primitive 4 per master brief §2.4) opens, Telegram bot notifies the tenant's designated approver (primitive 5), agent blocks until human resolves with `approve` / `reject` / `escalate-up`. Approval grants single-execution authority for the specific action_type + target + payload_hash — not a standing authorisation.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:67:Side effects refused. Agent does not get the chance to invoke. `decision_log` row with `phase='gating_failed'` and `payload.tier='red'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` fires (see §5).

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:7:**Surfaced by:** Master brief Day 5 spec; folds carry-forwards from `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 + `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + Day-4 §11 closing-commit work.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:63:**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:111:**Owner:** IFOS oncall + tenant operator. Daily check via `decision_log` queries: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_log WHERE phase='gating_failed' AND payload->>'tier'='red' AND payload->>'block_reason'='red_tier_classification' AND tenant_slug=? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:121:**Threshold:** Cost-per-completed-action (defined as: total IFOS infrastructure + API + Claude inference cost ÷ count of `decision_log` rows with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier IN ('green','yellow','orange-approved')`) exceeds **£0.50 per action** after 4 tenant-weeks of operation.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:134:**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 pilot scale; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); emerging from v1.0 pilot operations.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:144:**Rationale:** 15x headroom from the current £6.40/month single-tenant baseline (per Day-4 runbook §1.4: CX22 + 50 GB volume + backups = €5 + €1.20 + €2.40 ≈ £6.40). At 3 tenants on shared single-server architecture, expected cost should remain near baseline. If Postgres + LUKS-volume growth + vector-index growth pushes >£100/month at 3 tenants, infrastructure approach needs pivot.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:148:**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 single-tenant pilot; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); Risk #4 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (Hire #1 delays compound infrastructure spend if architecture sprawls).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:156:**Recovery path:** Rescoped infrastructure plan; pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (master brief does not specify a numeric cost target; budget adjustment is a runbook revision, not a master-brief edit).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:176:**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:21:The subsequent design pass (`docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md`) went further. Q1.4 found that **no IFOS agent calls `kb-*`** — the IFOS Agent Bundle v2 (master brief §8.1) has no `MEMORY.md`, no heartbeat memory file, and uses Postgres `decision_log` for the persistence role cortextOS's KB fills. The §3.4 seam was designed to shadow calls our agents don't make. Q3 evaluated three interface options against the post-design constraints (§3.2 rubric) and recommended Option α — a parallel `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` surface with no shadowing of cortextOS's bus.

The Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 single `entity_graph` table is **split** into `entities` (one row per entity) and `entity_links` (adjacency) — see Spec gap 2.4-B in the design doc.

docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:117:**For Day 4 this week (Postgres provisioning).** The `entity_graph` → `entities` + `entity_links` split per Spec gap 2.4-B / 3.4-B must land in the Day 4 migration. This is the only immediate-week impact of ADR-002.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:134:2. Edit 3 (Postgres table split, `entity_graph` → `entities` + `entity_links`) lands as part of the Day 4 Postgres provisioning task, this week.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:15:The §1.7 inheritance investigation in `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` found that `cortextos-ifos add-agent` copies the full `templates/agent/.claude/skills/` tree verbatim per `src/cli/add-agent.ts:88-110, 382-402` — 24 cortextOS template skills including `knowledge-base` (calls `kb-*` against cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB KB, which IFOS agents must not invoke per ADR-002) and `memory` (heartbeat-ingests `MEMORY.md` into the KB, which IFOS agents don't have because they use Postgres `decision_log` per master brief §8.1 Change 2). ADR-002 recommended R2 (bundle-only; no skill inheritance) but deferred the binding decision to this ADR.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:143:**For Week 1 work.** Renderer implementation is the load-bearing Week-1 deliverable. ADR-003 lands; renderer code follows in Weeks 1-2 per design §5.2. Eight prerequisite items tabled in §5.2 with owner + target week. Two of those prerequisites (`packages/agent-renderer/templates/claude-md-preamble.md` per spec gap §2.1-A; `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-*.json` per spec gap §2.1-B) are part of the renderer's own scaffolding effort. Two more (`_secrets.env` added to `provision-tenant.sh` skeleton per §2.1-C; Postgres `decision_log` live per master brief §6 Day 4) land at Day 4 of Week 0. First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:145:**For Week 0 remaining (Day 2 through Day 7).** ADR-003 doesn't unblock or block any remaining Week 0 work directly. Day 2 (Bullhorn integration path), Day 3 (sequencing + Brain UI scope), Day 4 (Postgres provisioning with `entities` + `entity_links` split per ADR-002 Edit 3 + `_secrets.env` skeleton), Day 5 (auto-send safety policy + kill criterion), Day 6 (vertical schema v0.1), Day 7 (single-sentence test + first Codex ratification) all proceed independently. The renderer is queued for Codex Day-7 review but does not gate Day 7's other reviews.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:149:**For Codex Day-7 ratification queue.** ADR-003 + the design doc join the queue alongside `cortextos-primitive-status.md`, ADR-001, ADR-002, `second-brain-design.md`, the deferred atomic master-brief correction commit, and the Day-4 Postgres provisioning artefact. The 22-item spec gap consolidation in design §5.4 plus the four-bucket structure (resolved inline / master-brief edits / Week-1+ prerequisites / operational defaults) is the ratification-supporting evidence.

docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:25:- **Operational hygiene B+** — Path B was allowed mid-Day-4 (LUKS passphrase entered chat); Day 4 execution had self-inflicted deviations (defensive `sudo file -s` check; missing `sudo` on `sshd -T`; outdated `findmnt` regex)
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:27:- **Citation accuracy B** — Day 5 §4.1 should have been §4.1 + §6.3 (caught in review); Day 6 "30+" action_type claim was actually 29 (caught in review); **15 fabricated "master brief §10.4" references propagated across 5 files** (caught in Day-6-evening citation audit; see §7 below)
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:55:**Day-4 lesson:** Path A was the initial agreed protocol for §4.2 luksFormat + §4.3 luksOpen + §4.8 ifos-unlock end-to-end test. Path B was authorised mid-Day-4 for the ifos-unlock test specifically; the operational friction of Path A was found acceptable for first-use (luksFormat) but unacceptable for repeated use (ifos-unlock). Mitigation: Path D pattern (§2.3) eliminates many would-be-Path-B cases by generating credentials on-VPS where they never need to be re-entered.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:76:**Day-4 incident (reference example of a correctly-handled Path B use):** Path B was authorised once for §4.8 ifos-unlock end-to-end test. Founder rotated WITHIN THE SAME SESSION via `cryptsetup luksChangeKey`; `--test-passphrase` verified OLD rejected + NEW accepted. The leaked passphrase in the transcript became cryptographically invalid against the LUKS volume. **Cost:** ~30 minutes of rotation work + permanent transcript-history annotation. Audit record: Day-4 close commit `98c79b2` + `.agents/decisions/2026-05-17-path-b-rotation-1.md`.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:78:**Path B was the right call for Day 4 ONLY because the protocol violation was acknowledged and the rotation was committed in the same session.** The Day-4 close commit (`98c79b2`) is the audit record. **Future sessions MUST avoid Path B by defaulting to Path A or Path D.** If Path B is invoked, the same-session-rotation discipline above is non-negotiable.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:129:**Day-4 lessons:**
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:202:3. **Numerical claims:** count. "29 action_types" not "30+". "10 entity_links" not "~10". If counting is hard, write the counting query (grep, wc -l, SQL) and run it.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:225:- "~10 entity_links" → forbidden. Count: 10. Write "10 entity_links".
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:231:**Day-6 lesson (§7 below):** 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4" references propagated across 5 files.

docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:260:Audit of citation accuracy across 4 main committed artefacts: Day-4 runbook, autosend-safety-policy.md, v1.0-kill-criterion.md, vertical-schema.yaml. Plus state files: RISK-REGISTER.md, current-priorities.md.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:268:**Root cause:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 invented "master brief §10.4 cost target" during drafting. The citation propagated through Day-5 kill criterion (3 instances), Day-5 autosend policy (1 instance), RISK-REGISTER (2 instances), current-priorities (1 instance) by trusting the Day-4 runbook citation rather than re-verifying against master brief. Citation transitivity, not master-brief drift.

agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:1:# Concierge — no candidate ghosted
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Each draft is written to vault at `/vault/<tenant>/concierge-drafts/<draft_id>.md` (canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split); approval routes through the autosend-bridge (Founder Decision D1 path) and on approval the send executes via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; agent-identity email adapter (deferred) deferred to v1.1+). Drafts are yellow-tier `concierge_email_draft` (internal, voice-classified, sample-spot-checked); the customer-facing send is orange-tier (`gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` or `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` depending on channel per autosend-policy.yaml lines 122-149). Gate A hard-fails any draft with voice classifier below the position-specific threshold (≥0.75 standard / ≥0.82 sensitive) OR any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). The 30-minute SLA from lifecycle event to draft is a Gate B leading metric (warning + aggregated; NOT a Gate A hard-fail) per the same ULTRAPLAN line — making it a hard-fail would block legitimate delayed drafts caused by Bullhorn polling fallbacks. Gate B success thresholds: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts + ≥90% 30-min SLA hit (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 §5.1: this independence is its strategic value when Bullhorn paths are delayed). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are orange-tier (`xero_reminder_draft_internal` per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` line 104; consultant approval required before send via Concierge); reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:90:For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. Output is a queued draft, NOT a send. Drafts route to Concierge (which handles the actual send pipeline + consultant approval per autosend §4 orange tier).

Two staged severity reductions specified (High → Medium on commercial answers; Medium → Low on first Week 3-4 Bullhorn write landing clean). Risk #7 edit count revised from 5 to 6 (Bullhorn decision §6.6 sixth edit added — master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 `service-account for dev` correction). No new risks surfaced from Day 2 — Sub-decisions A and B Proposed is the intended honest state pending commercial verification, not a new risk surface.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:61:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.

Master brief fully reconciled. **Risk #7 closed for atomic-correction commit** — 11 edits batch-applied at `0e5b2b4`; only remaining items are post-Codex-ratification iterations if Codex flags any of the 11 edits or two side effects (Edit 1 col 4 reframe + Edit 4 row merge). Codex Day-7 ratification queue at 21 items + 1 commit; **execution deferred** to extension period per Option C (skills not yet built + Q1 unblocker required first). `gstack` dev-tool installed Day 7 morning (`f5d2956` + `ce4bb33`) — meta-tooling for development; not part of IFOS product per `.agents/learnings/gstack-pin.md`.

docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:5:**Surfaced by:** `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` §"For Week 1 work" + `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` (full design)
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:13:ADR-002 §1.7-A surfaced the spec gap. Master brief §8 (lines 545-568) specifies the IFOS Agent Bundle v2 — six files plus three fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` — but is silent on how the bundle becomes a runnable cortextOS agent. The cortextOS daemon's `AgentManager.discoverAndStart()` (`packages/harness/cortextos/src/daemon/agent-manager.ts:906-941` `discoverAgents()`) reads from `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` with a cortextOS-shaped layout (`config.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env`). The two layouts are incompatible without translation.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:15:The §1.7 inheritance investigation in `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` found that `cortextos-ifos add-agent` copies the full `templates/agent/.claude/skills/` tree verbatim per `src/cli/add-agent.ts:88-110, 382-402` — 24 cortextOS template skills including `knowledge-base` (calls `kb-*` against cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB KB, which IFOS agents must not invoke per ADR-002) and `memory` (heartbeat-ingests `MEMORY.md` into the KB, which IFOS agents don't have because they use Postgres `decision_log` per master brief §8.1 Change 2). ADR-002 recommended R2 (bundle-only; no skill inheritance) but deferred the binding decision to this ADR.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:17:The design document (`docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) specified the renderer across five sections: source vs target layout (§1), the 12-row file mapping + R2 commitment + Concierge worked example (§2), six concrete mechanism decisions including TypeScript Node at `packages/agent-renderer/` (§3.1), manual developer invocation (§3.2), Option γ for `_shared/` origination (§3.3.3), and overwrite-no-merge re-render policy (§3.4), seven failure modes with exit codes (§4), and integration with the broader build (§5). 22 spec gaps surfaced and bucketed. This ADR ratifies the design's recommendations.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:54:The Concierge worked example in design §2.3 demonstrates end-to-end render: source bundle layout, CLAUDE.md preamble draft (resolves spec gap §2.1-A), materialised `config.json`, synthesised `.env`, hook files verbatim, `_shared/` symlink resolution.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:70:Three edits per design §5.3. Edits A and B land in this ADR's commit (small wording adds; Edit A is needed live before Week-1 renderer implementation). Edit C joins the deferred atomic correction commit alongside ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:139:Joins the deferred atomic correction commit (parallel to ADR-002 Edit 1 + Edit 2). Codex ratifies the combined commit on Day 7 per master brief §10.6.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:145:**For Week 0 remaining (Day 2 through Day 7).** ADR-003 doesn't unblock or block any remaining Week 0 work directly. Day 2 (Bullhorn integration path), Day 3 (sequencing + Brain UI scope), Day 4 (Postgres provisioning with `entities` + `entity_links` split per ADR-002 Edit 3 + `_secrets.env` skeleton), Day 5 (auto-send safety policy + kill criterion), Day 6 (vertical schema v0.1), Day 7 (single-sentence test + first Codex ratification) all proceed independently. The renderer is queued for Codex Day-7 review but does not gate Day 7's other reviews.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:149:**For Codex Day-7 ratification queue.** ADR-003 + the design doc join the queue alongside `cortextos-primitive-status.md`, ADR-001, ADR-002, `second-brain-design.md`, the deferred atomic master-brief correction commit, and the Day-4 Postgres provisioning artefact. The 22-item spec gap consolidation in design §5.4 plus the four-bucket structure (resolved inline / master-brief edits / Week-1+ prerequisites / operational defaults) is the ratification-supporting evidence.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:151:**For the master brief atomic correction commit.** Edit C (the §8 footnote) joins ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits in the deferred single commit at end of Week 0 / early Week 1. Edits A and B land in this batch's commit because (a) Edit A is needed live before Week-1 renderer implementation can scaffold the package path, (b) Edit B is a small wording add to a code block, (c) neither is substantive enough to warrant the atomic-correction overhead.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:156:- **`_shared/` helper code authoring** (`voice-loader.sh`, `hook-helpers.sh` contents) — already on the Week-1 prerequisite list per ADR-002 §"For Week 1 work." Not an ADR; just implementation work.

docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:164:2. Edit C (§8 footnote) joins ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits in the deferred atomic correction commit at end of Week 0 / early Week 1.

Detailed itemisation in §2.2 below |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:124:- **§2.1-B:** master brief §8.1 line 553 says `config.schema.json` extends "`common-*.json`" but doesn't say where the `common-*.json` shared schemas live. Recommended resolution: `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-{client, voice, notifications, vault, ats, accounting, target-patch}.json` per Ultraplan §5.3 line 357-364 enumeration. The renderer resolves `$ref` to these paths during schema materialisation.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:125:- **§2.1-C:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 names `_voice/`, `_playbooks/`, `_decisions/`, `_config.yaml` under `/vault/{tenant}/` but does not enumerate `_secrets.env`. Recommended resolution: add `_secrets.env` to the per-tenant vault skeleton; created at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 line 263 `provision-tenant.sh {slug}` step 2). Mode `0600` owned by `ifos-tenant-{slug}`. Per Master Brief §3.3 "structured data lives in Postgres" applies to entity data; per-tenant *secrets* are the canonical exception that lives on the filesystem.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:133:- **ADR-002 Decision 1** — cortextOS KB stays untouched; IFOS agents don't call `kb-*`. Inheriting `knowledge-base` and `memory` skills would mean IFOS agents have on-disk documentation telling them to invoke commands that, per ADR-002, they must not invoke.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:135:- **Master brief §3.1 (submodule boundary stays intact)** — the §3.1 exception for the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points is already a dead clause per ADR-002. Inheriting cortextOS skills would introduce a new implicit "shadow" — IFOS agents would carry skill documentation that points back into cortextOS's surface — undoing the cleanliness ADR-002 established.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:141:| `knowledge-base` | Calls `kb-query` / `kb-ingest` / `kb-collections` / `kb-setup` against cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB KB | IFOS uses `wiki-*` parallel bus wrappers against `/vault/{tenant}/wiki/` + Postgres `entities` / `entity_links` per ADR-002 Decision 2 and design §2.3 / §2.4 |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:144:| `tasks` | cortextOS task management — `create-task` / `update-task` / `complete-task` against the `orgs/{org}/tasks/` directory | IFOS uses Postgres `decision_log` for the "what did this agent do" trail and the wiki for the "what's the state of this entity" view. The cortextOS task store is unused by IFOS agents (parallel to the KB-untouched decision per ADR-002 Decision 1) |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:145:| `heartbeat` | cortextOS heartbeat cadence — periodic `update-heartbeat` writes to `${ctxRoot}/heartbeats/{name}.json` so the dashboard sees "alive" status | IFOS agents emit heartbeats too (the daemon's fast-checker writes them per `agent-process.ts:597-639` session timer), but the *cadence* and *what the agent does at each heartbeat* is specced per-agent in `agent.md` (Concierge always-on; Janitor cron-driven; etc.). The cortextOS-template `heartbeat/SKILL.md` is a default playbook — IFOS replaces with per-agent specifics |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:163:### 2.3 — Worked example: rendering Concierge (A6)
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:165:Concierge is the Tier-1 always-on candidate-lifecycle agent per master brief §8.2 A6 and Product Spec §2.2 R7. v1.0 build weeks 10-13.

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:354:# Concierge — Acme Recruitment
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:431:# Telegram (per Concierge's per-agent bot per cortextOS Primitive 5)
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:465:Rationale: matches existing IFOS package convention. Master brief §4.1 line 195-204 enumerates the operative package directories (`packages/{harness, brain, agents-runtime, vertical-adapters, mcp-connectors, context-assembly, decision-log, vault-syncer, voice, onboarding-wizard, dashboard-ext}/`); the renderer is a distinct concern (bundle → runtime translation) that doesn't belong inside any of those. It's not the brain (wiki content, per ADR-002), not the harness (read-only submodule per master brief §3.1), not agents-runtime/_shared/ (the shared helper *content*, not the *tooling* that materialises agents). Standalone `packages/agent-renderer/` keeps the surface clean.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:475:- `packages/brain/agent-cli/` — extending the brain CLI; rejected because the brain CLI is wiki ops (per ADR-002 Decision 2), and bundle rendering is not a wiki concern. Coupling two distinct CLIs into one package raises lock-in cost.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:491:- **Git pre-push hook:** fires too late — the push lands the bundle source in git, but the target tenant filesystem is on a different host (Hetzner UK VPS per Ultraplan §5.1 line 218), so a pre-push hook on a dev laptop has no access to the tenant vault to render against. v1.1+ if a hook integrates with a CI runner that has tenant access.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:538:- **Per-tenant config:** `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` per Ultraplan §5.1 line 220.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:540:- **Schema refs:** `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-{client,voice,notifications,vault,ats,accounting,target-patch}.json` per spec gap §2.1-B and Ultraplan §5.3 line 357-364.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:615:`ifos-render-agent render <agent-name> --tenant <slug>` — one render per call. To render Concierge across three tenants, three invocations. Scriptable via bash `for tenant in acme bravo charlie; do ifos-render-agent render concierge --tenant "$tenant"; done`.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:646:**Recovery:** stderr lists missing paths. Founder scaffolds the missing helpers (Week-1 prerequisite per ADR-002). Re-runs.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:666:**Recovery:** stderr: `Tenant <slug> not provisioned. Run: bash scripts/provision-tenant.sh <slug>`. Founder runs `provision-tenant.sh` per Ultraplan §5.5 step 2. Re-runs render.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:718:The cortextOS `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command (`packages/harness/cortextos/src/cli/add-agent.ts:18-316`) is **unchanged**. IFOS does **not** use it for IFOS-owned agents. The R2 commitment per ADR-002 §1.7-A drives this.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:729:6. The agent runs as a **cortextOS-template agent**, NOT as IFOS Concierge. It has `MEMORY.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `knowledge-base` skill, etc. — none of which IFOS expects.

docs/architecture/cortexos-kb-surface-investigation.md:14:Drafting ADR-002 began with the plan to read all four real files and pick one of three outcomes (full shadow / mixed shadow + new wrappers / abandon shadow). After reading **only `kb-setup.sh`**, the substrate of cortextOS's KB became clear, and that substrate is incompatible with the IFOS wiki data model in master brief §5. The ADR's scope is too narrow to absorb that finding — it would be designing the second brain inside an architectural decision record, on the side of an audit.

docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md:683:| 4 | Bullhorn A+B response arrives with surprise terms (e.g., marketplace required + £25k/year) | Medium | Fold answer into Concierge / Janitor / Scribe / Sourcing Scout §8 build-prereq; surface kill-criterion Trigger 3 review |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:9:Two findings need founder review before the Day 7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 / Ultraplan §12). Both are master-brief drifts against the verified SHA, surfaced in Primitive 3:
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:22:| 1 | Persistent PTY via PM2 | **shipped but flaky** | Cash Conductor (A4), Concierge (A6) |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:23:| 2 | 71-hour context rotation | **shipped and tested** | Concierge (A6) |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:25:| 4 | Approval gates | **shipped and tested** | Cash Conductor (A4), Concierge (A6); standing-auth not in cortextOS — IFOS-layer concept |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:61:- Master brief §2.4 row 1: used by Triage, Concierge, Pulse, Watchtower, Cash Conductor.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:62:- §8.2 v1.0 build order: **A4 Cash Conductor (Tier 1, weeks 7-8)** and **A6 Concierge (Tier 1, weeks 9-10)** require it.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:66:**Risk if flaky:** Tier-1 always-on agents collapse to scheduled cron with cold-start latency, eliminating the "sub-second to first useful action" claim that justifies pricing the Triage/Concierge/Pulse demos above point-tool parity (Ultraplan §3.2). Per Ultraplan §3.1 row 1, the documented contingency is: "Ship the v1.0 agents as scheduled cron with a documented migration path. Loses the Triage closing demo but keeps the build moving." Quirk 2 (`.agents/learnings/00-cortextos-quirks.md`) — `node-pty` requires `npm rebuild` on Node 25+ — is the most likely re-trip wire because the Mac Studio cluster nodes for the v2.0 Sovereign tier may not run Node 22 LTS by default.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:120:- Master brief §2.4 row 2: Concierge (cross-week candidate conversations), Watchtower (per-contractor state), Pulse (multi-source watching).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:121:- v1.0 build: **A6 Concierge** (master brief §8.2, weeks 9-10) holds candidate-lifecycle state across days; loses context-rollover gracefulness if this primitive fails.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:124:**Risk if flaky:** Concierge loses cross-week candidate conversation context at the 71-hour boundary or at API overflow; rejection drafts lose the prior-state nuance that defines Gate A voice quality on the hardest test case (Ultraplan §8.1 A6 gotcha: "Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case — get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship"). Per Ultraplan §3.1 row 2, the documented contingency is: "Manual restart cadence acceptable for v1.0 pilots; flag as known limitation in pilot agreement."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:182:1. **No `chokidar` watcher in the bus.** The bus is poll-based, not push-based. `grep -rn chokidar src/` returns zero hits; `chokidar@^5.0.0` in `package.json:47` is used only by `dashboard/src/lib/watcher.ts:5` for the dashboard UI's file change feed, not for inter-agent message delivery. Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:189:- §8.2 v1.1: A8 **Brief Decoder** is the load-bearing test of the file bus + handoff to Sourcing Scout → Concierge (Ultraplan §3.1 row 3: "This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2"). v1.0 agents don't strictly depend on the bus for inter-agent handoff — but they do depend on it for KB read/write.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:255:- Master brief §2.4 row 4 + §3.4 + Product Spec §6.1 row 4: every agent that auto-sends. Triage, Concierge, Cash Conductor, Competitor Interception, Spec Pitcher, T1 Onboarding Concierge — all depend on the approval gate to graduate from drafts-only.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:256:- v1.0: A4 Cash Conductor (chase email + escalation tier) and A6 Concierge (auto-send acknowledge-new-candidate at Boutique+). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #9, "A consultant complains about auto-send tone within first 2 weeks → Auto-send paused immediately for that tenant" — the approval gate is the kill-switch.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:257:- v1.1: A7 Inbound Triage's auto-send is the most dangerous; per Ultraplan §8.2 A7 gotcha: "Misclassification of a complaint as a routine inbound is a relationship killer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:259:**Risk if flaky:** Every Tier-1 auto-send agent collapses to drafts-only — the documented v1.0 Risk-#1 contingency (Ultraplan §3.5: "Every Tier 1 agent has a 'degraded mode' fallback (drafts-only, no auto-send, scheduled retry) that runs if cortextOS state is unhealthy"). Loses the Triage and Cash Conductor closing demos but does NOT kill v1.0.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:296:Telegram is mature, hardened, and well-tested. iOS is explicitly "coming soon" in the README and has no APNs/push-notification code path — only an `outbound-messages.jsonl` log shape that a future iOS app would consume. Ultraplan §3.1 row 5 already accepts iOS deferral to v1.2, so this is not a v1.0 blocker.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:324:- Master brief §2.4 row 5: every Tier-1 agent's escalation path. Triage, Concierge, Cash Conductor, Pulse, Watchtower, Brief Decoder, Competitor Interception, Night Sourcer, T5, Timesheet Ranger — they all escalate via Telegram and approve via Telegram inline buttons.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:328:**Risk if flaky:** Telegram alone covers v1.0; iOS deferral is already an accepted decision per Ultraplan §3.1 row 5 ("iOS in v1.2 is the marketing line, not a tech blocker"). Real risk is Telegram outage during a Cash Conductor escalation, which is exactly what the activity-channel + per-agent-bot belt-and-braces pattern (primitive 4 evidence, `approval.ts:222-226`) was built to mitigate after the "50h+ Repo-B-style stall" incident.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:370:Full experiment lifecycle code, dedicated sprint-3 test file, fully-documented 8-phase theta-wave skill shipped in the `analyst` template. Approval-gate integration ties it back into primitive 4. Not on the v1.0 critical path — Ultraplan §3.1 row 6 already defers it to v1.1 Night Sourcer.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:389:- v1.0: **No agent depends on this.** Ultraplan §3.1 row 6: "This is for the Night Sourcer in v1.1, not v1.0. Defer the question."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:390:- v1.1: **A11 Night Sourcer** (Ultraplan §8.2, weeks 9-10) is the canonical use case — "8-12 reviewed candidates per brief every morning at 06:30" (Product Spec §2.2 R4).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:393:**Risk if flaky:** Night Sourcer becomes a daytime cron with rate-limit pain — kills the "Walk in to 27 reviewed candidates across your live briefs every morning" pitch (Product Spec §10 line 525). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6: "LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected → defer Night Sourcer to v1.2 if needed" — overnight autoresearch is also the budgeting layer for the LinkedIn rate limit (Ultraplan §8.2 A11 gotcha: "Build the rate-limit budget allocator carefully; this is where £40-60/mo of the £200 per-tenant compute cost lives").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:456:- v1.0: **No agent depends on this.** Ultraplan §3.1 row 7: "This is for v1.1+. Defer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff. Ultraplan §3.1 row 3 already names this as the bus's load-bearing test ("This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:460:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder slips to v1.2 — the documented contingency in Ultraplan §3.1 row 3. Loses the "shortlist in 90 minutes" demo for the Growth tier. The "orchestrator-coupled Telegram polling" trade-off (`agent-manager.ts:465-472`) means if the orchestrator agent itself crashes, the activity-channel callbacks stop until restart — primitive 1's crash-loop alert covers that case.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:3:**Status:** Reference (no Proposed/Accepted lifecycle). Synthesis of `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` §2.6 + `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` Decisions 2-3 + `docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md` §5-A `decision_log.phase` extension.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:6:**Surfaced by:** `ADR-002` §"For Week 1 work" + `second-brain-design.md` Spec gap 2.6 + `sequencing-target.md` §6.5 (Day-4 Postgres provisioning consolidation).
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:20:- **Agent processes** (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per `sequencing-target.md` §2.2-§2.6) — write `wiki/compiled/{candidates,clients,placements,people}/*.md` and `wiki/raw/*/` ingest paths.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:21:- **Wiki library** (`packages/brain/wiki/lib/*.ts` per ADR-002 Decision 2) — the read/write API every agent invokes; serialises and coordinates the above.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:30:Four mechanisms address these four failure modes in §2-§5. **All four mechanisms must be implemented in `wiki/lib/concurrency.ts`** for the wiki API to ship in v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 row 6 (Concierge, the heaviest concurrency stressor).
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:35:- Multi-tenant filesystem isolation — kernel-enforced per Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 (`ifos-tenant-{slug}` OS user); not a concurrency concern within a tenant.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:36:- Cross-tenant read consistency — RLS handles this at the Postgres layer per ADR-002 Decision 3; not a wiki-library concern.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:192:- If second attempt also fails: raise `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`, record in `decision_log` with `phase='gating_failed'` per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A enum extension, log human-readable error to operator Telegram per primitive 5 escalation surface.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:265:**Substrate:** discover all entities that reference the target via `entity_links` table per `second-brain-design.md` §2.4.2; iterate in deadlock-safe order; apply the rewrite under per-entity flock per §2; update `entity_links` rows in a single Postgres transaction per ADR-002 Decision 3.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:409:All five route via `hh_decision_log` from master brief §8.1 Change 2 + `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` pattern from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.1. **All 5 codes catalogued + wired as of Day 8 2026-05-20** at `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` §2.2 (commit `a279226`) and `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh::autosend_escalate` (commit `e6e9df1`). Test coverage in `agents/_shared/tests/test-hook-helpers.sh`.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:429:**None from this document.** The concurrency design was already authorised by `ADR-002` Decisions 2-3 + `second-brain-design.md` §2.6. This document is reference / specification, not a new decision — it does not surface fresh master-brief drifts.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:441:The `entities.version` column is a new Day-4 tightening — joins the three already on the list per `sequencing-target.md` §6.5 (entity_graph split + `_secrets.env` + `decision_log.phase` enum extension). Day-4 task now has **4 consolidated tightenings**.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:24:| 10-13 | Concierge |
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:47:1. **Diagnostic is the named first agent.** `sequencing-target.md` §3.1 ratified Build Wave 1 = Diagnostic. Doing it earlier doesn't violate the sequence — it accelerates it.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:52:6. **Documented contingency.** This is the milder version of ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 row contingency: *"defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1."* We're deferring only the Bullhorn-touching agents pending Bullhorn answer; Diagnostic stays on track.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:69:| Bullhorn unresponsive past 2026-06-10 | Force Direct-API fallback per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.4; Janitor scaffold begins; Bullhorn auth gated on first pilot raising support ticket |
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:76:- Concierge (W10-13) touches Bullhorn read+write; same gating + needs D1 autosend decision
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:78:**Net effect of worst case (Bullhorn never responds + Direct-API forced):** Janitor + Scribe + Sourcing Scout + Concierge all slip ~1 week each; Cash Conductor (W7-8) unaffected; v1.0 ships in W14 instead of W13. Master brief §8.2 line 604 acknowledges this contingency.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:108:- `sequencing-target.md` §3.1 (Build Wave 1 = Diagnostic)
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:110:- `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.4 (Direct-API fallback architecture for slow Bullhorn response)
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:8:**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:16:> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:89:     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:177:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:221:- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:279:| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:286:3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.
docs/operations/seedlegals-engagement-queries.md:68:> 1. **Service scope:** SaaS-delivered AI agent fleet for UK recruitment agencies (Bullhorn ATS integration; bounded action set defined in autosend-safety-policy attached as Appendix A).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:4:**Status:** Reference. Q3 recommendation non-binding; ADR-002 ratifies it.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:5:**Surfaced by:** `docs/architecture/cortexos-kb-surface-investigation.md` — the cortextOS KB substrate is incompatible with the IFOS wiki data model, and the gap is large enough that the second brain needs its own design before ADR-002 can land.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:8:**Reading order:** the investigation doc first, then this. Then ADR-002.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:78:The exception in §3.1 becomes a dead clause: there are four `bus/kb-*.sh` files but we don't shadow them. The §3.4 wording needs to change to reflect this (ADR-002 will specify the replacement wording).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:154:Two source documents touch on vault structure. Master brief §5.1 (lines 297-349) and Ultraplan §5.1 (line 220) **disagree** — flagged as **Spec gap 2.1-A** in the final section. Master brief wins per §0; this design merges the two so nothing is lost.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:440:- Hard-delete-per-entity — v1.2+; v1.0/v1.1 hard-delete is only at tenant offboarding (Ultraplan §5.5)
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:442:**The `semantic-search-over-raw` row is the bridge to ADR-002.** Q3 will recommend whether to use cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB for this future operation (which would require shadowing exactly the `bus/kb-ingest.sh` + `bus/kb-query.sh` pair against `raw/` content), or build an IFOS-native pgvector index over raw/ — both are tenable, both are v1.2+ work, neither needs a decision before Week 11.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:450:- **Path:** `/vault/{tenant-slug}/` on the shared encrypted LUKS volume (Ultraplan §5.1 line 218). Sub-paths per §2.1 above.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:451:- **Ownership:** OS user `ifos-tenant-{slug}` in group `ifos-tenants`, mode `0700` on the tenant root, `0644` on files (Ultraplan §5.1 lines 218-223). The PM2 agent process for tenant X runs as `ifos-tenant-{X}` and cannot read tenant Y's vault — kernel enforces this.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:458:  - **Filesystem:** Restic nightly to S3-compatible UK-region storage, 30 days of dailies + 12 months of monthlies (Ultraplan §5.6 line 281). RPO 5 minutes, RTO 4 hours (Ultraplan §5.6 line 283).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:459:  - **Git:** **Spec gap 2.4-A.** Neither master brief nor Ultraplan specifies whether `/vault/{tenant}/` is also a git repo. Obsidian users typically git-init their vaults. **Recommendation:** yes — initialize `/vault/{tenant}/.git/` at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder gets free history, blame, and rollback via Obsidian Git plugin. Agents do NOT commit; the founder commits manually or via a scheduled cron run by Janitor's nightly sweep. **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — git init is one line in `provision-tenant.sh`; commit cadence can be decided in Week 1.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:463:Three tables anchored in Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 ("`tenants`, `entity_graph`, `decision_log`"). The IFOS design here renames `entity_graph` to **`entities`** (one row per entity) and adds **`entity_links`** (the adjacency table) — both flagged below as **Spec gap 2.4-B** because Ultraplan groups them under a single name.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:465:**Table: `tenants`** (master brief §3.3 + Ultraplan §5.1)
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:540:**Table: `decision_log`** (master brief §8.1 Change 2 lines 170-173; Ultraplan §5.1 line 227)
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:567:Partitioned by hash on `tenant_slug` (Ultraplan §5.1 line 228: "Both `entity_graph` and `decision_log` partitioned by `tenant_id` (hash partitioning, 32 partitions to start)"). This is the **only** source of entity-history queries — the `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 is for narrative summaries (Spec gap 2.1-B remains; recommended resolution: `_decisions/` is for founder-written end-of-quarter narratives only, not for agent decisions; agent decisions live exclusively in `decision_log`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:569:**Spec gap 2.4-B:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 groups entity index + adjacency under "`entity_graph`". This design splits them into `entities` + `entity_links` for clearer indexing semantics. **Recommended resolution:** adopt the split; update master brief §3.3 or Ultraplan §5.1 to reflect the two-table model. Codex-ratifiable on Day 7 by reading this section.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:575:**v1.0 use:** voice corpus only. Ultraplan §6.1 line 314 says "samples/{n}.md — raw samples indexed for RAG retrieval (embedded with pgvector at capture time)" and line 322 says voice-loader.sh retrieves "the 3 most semantically similar past samples to the current task via pgvector cosine similarity."
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:600:1. **Forward-compatibility with semantic-search-over-raw (v1.2+).** If the eventual Pulse-like agent uses cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB for raw/ content, IFOS-side and cortextOS-side embeddings live in the same vector space and a query embedded once can search both indexes. ADR-002 will recommend keeping this hook open.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:615:**v1.2+ forward-compatibility hook:** the semantic-search-over-raw operation (v1.2+) is the one place where cortextOS's substrate could come back into the picture. ADR-002 will recommend leaving the option open — i.e. don't dismantle cortextOS's KB tooling — without scoping the v1.2 work now.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:672:| `search-by-name` | Postgres `entities` trigram on `display_name` (`gin_trgm_ops`) | Filesystem grep over `wiki/compiled/{type}/*.md` frontmatter | Hot path; sub-second target.

Fallback only fires if Postgres unhealthy (per master brief §3.5 RLS / Ultraplan §3.5 degraded-mode contingency). |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:680:| `semantic-search-over-raw` | **v1.2+ deferred** — placeholder primary = either cortextOS mmrag/ChromaDB **OR** IFOS-native pgvector over chunked raw/ content | n/a | ADR-002 will recommend keeping cortextOS's substrate available as the v1.2+ implementation option without committing to it now. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:688:**No operation reads via grep at hot path.** All hot-path reads go through Postgres. Filesystem reads are the source-of-truth fallback for the rare unhealthy-Postgres case (which itself triggers the degraded-mode fallback per Ultraplan §3.5).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:708:- t=0: Concierge calls `append-to-narrative(candidate_sarah_bowen, "Sent follow-up email")`. Acquires `sarah_bowen.md.lock`. Reads file. Reads `updated_at = T0` from Postgres.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:710:- t=0+300ms: Concierge releases flock after writing the narrative line and updating Postgres (`updated_at = T1`). The atomic file rename completes.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:711:- t=0+301ms: Janitor acquires flock. Reads file (now contains Concierge's append). Reads Postgres (`updated_at = T1`). Computes new frontmatter. Writes file atomically. Postgres UPDATE `WHERE updated_at = T1` succeeds (`updated_at = T2`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:751:v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic (no vault writes; sales-only), Janitor (heavy writes — nightly batch of thousands of Bullhorn entity updates), Scribe (per-call writes; ~30-60 min/day per consultant per Product Spec §2.2 R6), Cash Conductor (writes Placement updates on invoice events; reads heavily for invoice context), Sourcing Scout (read-heavy; produces drafts that the agent itself writes elsewhere), Concierge (per-lifecycle-event writes; reads candidate state on every inbound).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:755:- `search-by-name` — Concierge inbound message processing; the customer-facing latency claim ("60-second response" per Product Spec §2.2 R1) depends on this returning in <100ms.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:757:- `append-to-narrative` — Concierge / Scribe logging; tolerates few-hundred-ms.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:771:| Concierge | 20:1 | reads candidate state on every lifecycle event; writes only on event transitions |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:778:**Peak concurrent agents per tenant (v1.0):** 4-5 — Janitor (nightly batch but daytime cleanup tasks too), Scribe (webhook-driven per-call), Cash Conductor (always-on watcher), Sourcing Scout (request-response), Concierge (always-on). At Boutique-tier these all run in one PM2 process group per tenant; at Scale-tier the same.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:780:**Peak concurrent tenants on shared infra (v1.0):** 3-6 (Product Spec §3 first three paid pilots target). The shared Postgres + RLS model (Ultraplan §5.1 line 226) handles this trivially.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:782:**Decision-log volume:** every agent run produces 1-3 `decision_log` rows (`hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, optionally `hh_decision_action` when human responds). At 6 v1.0 agents × ~10 runs/agent/day × 3 tenants × 3 rows = ~540 rows/day per shared Postgres instance. Trivial volume; the table needs hash partitioning (per Ultraplan §5.1) primarily for query performance at v1.2+ scale, not v1.0 write throughput.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:890:| **Multi-tenancy enforcement** — how `tenant_slug` is validated at the entry point (master brief §3.5) | Wrapper reads `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` env var (set by PM2 ecosystem per-tenant process group); CLI handler validates that the arg `--tenant` matches the env or fails with `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK`. Kernel-enforced isolation underneath (POSIX 0700 per Ultraplan §5.1) means a wrong tenant fails at filesystem read. | Server receives `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` at connection setup via MCP server args; rejects any tool call whose `tenant_slug` mismatches the connection identity. Filesystem isolation underneath same as α. One enforcement site. | Library validates `tenant_slug` against env var. Same enforcement model as α, but agent-side discipline depends on skill docs being followed. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:891:| **Operational complexity** — new infrastructure introduced | None new. 12 shell wrappers + a Node CLI binary + a library; same shape as `packages/harness/cortextos/bus/`. No new PM2 process. | One new PM2 process per machine (`ifos-wiki-mcp`). Adds to the operations surface: process supervision, restart policy, port allocation, logs to manage. At Sovereign tier (one cluster slice per tenant per Ultraplan §5.4) this is one extra process per tenant. | Skill files added to every agent at scaffold time. Under R2 renderer (recommended), the renderer must be extended to inject the wiki skill — additional renderer logic. Under R1, automatic. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:895:| **Failure mode if cortextOS daemon is unhealthy** | Wrappers don't depend on the daemon — they exec directly into Node. As long as Postgres is up and the filesystem is mounted, wiki ops succeed. Decision_log writes still go through (Postgres direct). Tracks per Ultraplan §3.5 "Tier 1 agents have degraded-mode fallbacks" — the wiki is part of the fallback substrate, not part of what fails. | If `ifos-wiki-mcp` crashes, every agent loses wiki access until it restarts. PM2 auto-restart bounds the outage to ~5s, but during the outage every wiki call fails. If `cortextos-daemon` is unhealthy, MCP connections from agents (which are in PTYs supervised by the daemon) may also be affected. Two-process dependency. | Same as α (library invoked directly, no daemon dependency) but adds skill-discovery path: if the agent's Claude Code session can't find the skill (e.g. corrupted scaffold), all wiki ops fail. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:908:3. **Master brief §3.5 + §5.5 (multi-tenancy + onboarding wizard 5-day flow).** §3.5's "100 customers by end of 2027" stress test (Product Spec §5.4) demands zero per-customer operational drag. Option α adds no per-customer infrastructure. Option β at Sovereign tier (Ultraplan §5.4 per-tenant cluster slice) means one `ifos-wiki-mcp` process per Sovereign tenant — a new operational surface to monitor at scale.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:913:- **Persistent server state.** Option β's long-running process could cache hot reads, hold prepared statements, maintain pgvector connection pools. Option α pays a fresh Node startup per call (~80-200ms). For v1.0 expected volume (Concierge ~10 lifecycle events/day per tenant × 3 tenants × 5 wiki reads each = 150 calls/day per machine), the cumulative startup cost is ~30 seconds/day. Acceptable. **If hot-path latency becomes a constraint at v1.2+**, we can introduce a persistent CLI daemon (`wiki-cli --daemon`) that pre-warms — a future optimisation without changing the agent surface.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:922:- **v1.2+ semantic-search-over-raw:** ADR-002 will recommend keeping this hook open. Under Option α, the eventual implementation is a `wiki-semantic-search.sh` that internally chooses either cortextOS's mmrag (the v1.2+ option) or an IFOS-native pgvector-over-raw index — no agent-side change.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:944:- **Week 13:** wiki-aware agent integration — Concierge (v1.0 A6, master brief §8.2) is the first user; voice-loader.sh from §2.4.3 reads `voice_samples_embedded` via the new library; first end-to-end Concierge run hits the wiki for `search-by-name` and `update-entity`. Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view from master brief §6 Day 3) is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed.

In v1.0, those orange action_types must either:
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:22:- **D1-A: Become red in v1.0** — refuse all orange action_types entirely. Concierge can't send customer-visible Bullhorn Notes at all in v1.0. Diagnostic can't send outbound emails.

docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:15:Per master brief §5.5 (lines 416-424) after ADR-002 Edit 2 applies in the atomic correction commit, the staged Brain UI build is:
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:24:**Revisit trigger:** start of v1.1 phase (estimated Q4 2026 post-v1.0 launch per Ultraplan §9 line 725 + Product Spec §9.2 v1.1 timing). Three v1.0 observations will inform the v1.1 scoping session:
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:28:3. What the first paying design partner asks for after Concierge ships in v1.0 — direct user-research input.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:34:Three features named in master brief §5.5 (post-ADR-002-Edit-2 wording) + `second-brain-design.md` §3.4. Each feature scoped here without implementation commitment.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:41:- Shows recent `decision_log` entries with phase + outcome filtering (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff` per `sequencing-target.md` §5.3 + §6.5 enum extension).
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:42:- Highlights pending approvals (Concierge auto-send escalations per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4).
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:44:- Per-tenant scoped via RLS per ADR-002 §3 Decision 3; multi-tenant founder view aggregates across tenant_slugs.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:55:**Dependency on v1.0:** wiki API live + `decision_log` populated per ADR-002 §3 Decision 3 + extended phase enum per `sequencing-target.md` §6.5.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:134:No UI work. Wiki API + Postgres + pgvector + filesystem is the v1.0 deliverable per ADR-002 Edit 2 + `second-brain-design.md` §3.4 closing paragraph. Master brief §5.5 already correctly scopes this (post-Edit-2). No new constraint from this document.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:150:- **Agent outputs in design partner's existing tools** — Bullhorn notes (Janitor + Scribe writes), Outlook / Gmail emails (Concierge auto-send drafts), Telegram approval messages (per cortextOS Primitive 5).
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:176:> "- [ ] **Brain UI scope decision.** Per §5.5 (post-ADR-002 Edit 2 atomic correction): v1.0 ships the parallel `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` wrappers + `wiki/lib/*.ts` modules + Postgres tables + pgvector voice index — **no Brain UI yet**. v1.1 adds the today-view + backlinks panel + wiki-find UI; v1.2 adds the graph view. **Confirm this in `docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md`** — or document the deviation."
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:180:1. **Path** `.agents/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md` → `docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md` (same convention drift as line 471, fixed in `sequencing-target.md` §6.8 as the 7th edit).
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:181:2. **`kb-*` shadow language** → `wiki-*` parallel system (corrects against ADR-002 Edit 1 §3.4 brain-replacement seam wording).

docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:154:🔔 Approval request: Concierge bullhorn_note_customer_visible
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:254:**Recommended:** Week 9 of master brief sequence (W9 = `2026-07-14` if Week 1 starts `2026-05-21`). Buffers 2-3 days before Concierge W10-13 starts. Allows:

docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:259:**Alternative:** as the next IFOS Claude slice (now). Pre-builds the prerequisite before Diagnostic W3-4 starts, so it's not blocking Concierge. ~2-3 days inserted before Diagnostic.
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:308:- Unblocks Concierge build (W10-13) — without this, Concierge can only ship as drafts-only (D1-A) which loses the demo value prop

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:3:**Status:** Pre-Build-Round-16-Reviewed (Day-19; full bundle built — agent.md + cycle.sh + validate.sh + context.sh + tools.yaml + cleanup.sh + 3 fixtures all present. 16 Codex review-agent-bundle rounds attempted; ADR-006 closed Cat-1/Cat-ζ Gate A architectural finding (R10); subsequent rounds reduced from 5→5→4→5→5→4→5 mechanical findings with steady-state ~5 findings/round at the cross-reference-sync layer. Per master brief §10.3 step 5: founder-arbitrated Accepted on next bilateral pass OR per documented disagreement. Status flips Proposed → Accepted when ALL: (a) bilateral founder review of remaining mechanical findings, AND (b) founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical, AND (c) first production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds, AND (d) Gate B baseline measurement begins.)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 line 595 (row 1; anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`. **Drift flag:** Ultraplan §8.1 A1 (line 489) calls Diagnostic build wave 4-5; master brief line 595 calls it W3-4. Master brief is authoritative per CLAUDE.md (master brief wins on every conflict); W3-4 is the build wave for IFOS.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 line 489.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:8:**Tier:** 2 (request-driven; no persistent PTY) per sequencing-target.md §2.1.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:16:> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A's per-section citation subcheck hard-fails on any section missing its citation, per `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` (Accepted; Day 19 founder-arbitrated). ADR-006 establishes Gate A as per-section hard-fail; per-claim citation analysis is a separate post-launch quality metric outside Gate A (future W4 ADR + schema supplements). The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (target voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`; v0 implementation warns + exits 0 when `IFOS_VOICE_CLASSIFIER_URL` is unreachable per §5 honesty note — W4 polish closes this to unconditional hard-fail) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:33:Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical wall-clock: 10-15 minutes (empirical Day-13 measurement against Hays plc + Charterhouse fixtures); not specified in upstream master brief or Ultraplan.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:64:**Gate A hard-fails** (per ADR-006 + §5 spec):
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:67:- Any section with zero citation links (per-section citation subcheck; ADR-006-canonical)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:114:   → per-section citation hard-fail (ADR-006 Tier 1; no warn-only path)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:146:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4 + `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` (Accepted; Day 19 founder-arbitrated). Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:148:**Per ADR-006 (canonical interpretation of ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1 line 496 Gate A clause "no claims unsupported by source data"):** Gate A's citation subcheck is per-section hard-fail (every one of the 12 sections has ≥1 evidence link). Per-claim citation analysis is a SEPARATE post-launch quality metric, NOT Gate A — to be authored as a future W4 ADR with schema supplements when the voice-classifier microservice ships + first pilot tenant accumulates ≥30 reports.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:150:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements the per-section citation subcheck as hard-fail today (no warn-only path). It also implements the voice classifier and PII subchecks but **prints warnings to stdout and exits 0** when upstream services are unreachable (voice-classifier URL down, firm-domain whitelist absent) — these warnings are visible in stdout but no separate `decision_log` audit row is written. W4 polish closes these two cases to (a) unconditional hard-fail behaviour AND (b) explicit `validate_check_skipped` audit rows. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the voice + PII gaps. ADR-006 does NOT modify the voice + PII subchecks — only the citation subcheck.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:161:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `action_type='consultant_feedback'` (registered green-tier action_type per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`); outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with the registered `consultant_feedback` action_type rather than a new sentinel.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:182:- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:218:| `validate.sh` Gate A logic (12-section check) | `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` | ✅ Built; per-section subcheck hard-fail per ADR-006; voice + PII subchecks warn-only on upstream-unavailable per §5 honesty note (W4 polish closes) |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:222:| Codex ratification of full agent bundle | Post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill | ⚠ 10 rounds attempted; ADR-006 (Accepted) closed Cat-1 Gate A finding; residual mechanical findings tracked in disagreement doc Phase 4-5 |

Codex review-agent-bundle ratification in progress (10+ rounds; ADR-006 closed the Cat-1/Cat-ζ Gate A finding; iterating on smaller mechanical findings).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:238:| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:245:### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:24:Operational consequence: end-to-end latency of an N-hop agent pipeline is **bounded below by N × `pollInterval`**. At the default 1000ms with the 4-agent Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (3 hops), the floor is ≥3 seconds. The current master brief §3.2 / Ultraplan §3.2 narrative ("four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes") is technically consistent with this floor at 1000ms — but only just, and a customer-facing claim of "sub-second handoff" would be wrong.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:46:| **A. Accept the floor** | Leave `pollInterval` at the 1000ms default. Rewrite Ultraplan §3.2's "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" to "four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end" and remove any "sub-second handoff" framing from the closing-demo deck | Zero engineering | Honest signal; Concierge's "30-min lifecycle event → drafted comms" SLA is unaffected (3-5s is rounding error against 30 minutes); Brief Decoder's "90-min brief-to-shortlist" is also unaffected. Only sales narrative changes. |
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:52:2. The user-visible SLAs (Concierge 30-min lifecycle event, Brief Decoder 90-min shortlist, Triage 60-second response) all have ≥30× headroom against a 3-5 second pipeline floor. The pipeline-latency claim is sales narrative, not product SLA.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:59:- Single edit to Ultraplan §3.2: rewrite "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes" → "four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound."
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:72:- The brain-replacement seam (§3.4) is unaffected by this ADR. ADR-002 covers that separately.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:76:**Accepted — Option A.** Founder decision logged 2026-05-16. The master brief §2.4 row 3 + Ultraplan §3.2 edits are deferred to a single atomic "spec drift reconciliation" commit that lands alongside whatever ADR-002 dictates for §3.4. Codex ratifies the combined commit on Day 7 with the other Week 0 artefacts.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:1:# Codex disagreement — bullhorn-integration-path Week-1 implementation gate
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:4:**Artefact disagreed on:** `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:31:Specifically: per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1 line 96, Diagnostic (the first agent build, W3-4) is explicitly "no Bullhorn; Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY)." Per ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1, Diagnostic's MCP tools are "Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages" — no Bullhorn. **Diagnostic W3-4 build does not touch the Bullhorn auth path at all.**
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:48:The bullhorn-integration-path.md line 95 wording is arguably ambiguous — "Week-1 implementation can proceed" without qualifying "Week-1 prereq code only, not agent-build slices" is loose. The fix is wording sharpening, not gate-tightening.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:54:- [ ] Incorporated (Codex correct; rewrite bullhorn-integration-path §95 to make all Week-1 implementation conditional on A+B Accepted)
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:72:**Round-2 remediation update (2026-05-22):** this source-document sharpening landed in this commit alongside the new `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Gate hierarchy subsection.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:82:- **Split the difference** — line 95 wording sharpens AND a new explicit "Week-1 prereq vs W5 agent-build gate hierarchy" subsection is added to bullhorn-integration-path.md §1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:6:**Surfaced by:** Master brief §6 Day 3 (lines 469-473) — "Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's 'close first 3 pilots fastest' → `.agents/decisions/sequencing-target.md`" (note: master brief §6 names `.agents/decisions/`; this document lives at `docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md` matching the convention established by ADR-001 through ADR-003 + bullhorn-integration-path.md — **Spec gap §1-A** flagged for atomic correction).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §8.2 (the build-order table) + Ultraplan §9 (the existing 14-week sprint plan) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + §6 for the Bullhorn-dependency carry-forward; then `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` §5.2 for the renderer's Week-1-prerequisite role.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:26:| A6 | Concierge | 10-13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:32:- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:42:**Weeks 5-13 planning is speculative without §B.** Each agent's prerequisites (Bullhorn MCP, Fathom/Fireflies, Xero, LinkedIn) have lead times. Bullhorn MCP work itself starts Week 1 per Ultraplan §9 line 724 ("Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it"). Without knowing the agent build order, those infrastructure prereqs can't be sequenced.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:46:The Day-7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 Day 7 / Ultraplan §12) doesn't directly test sequencing — but Q4 ("Have we scoped the Agent Bundle v2 refactor and is the work <5 days?") and the Week-0 deliverable list at Ultraplan §9 line 737-741 both assume a sequenced plan exists. The Day 7 review surfaces this document for Codex ratification.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:50:Six criteria to evaluate each agent against in §2. Each criterion scored High / Medium / Low or with a concrete number; substantive cells in §2 must justify the score by reference to master brief / Ultraplan / Product Spec / Day-2 Bullhorn decision.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:57:| 4 | **Commercial value** | Whether the agent's output is demoable to a design partner / first paying customer per Product Spec §2.2 R-rows | Earlier commercial-value agents accelerate the first-pilot conversion (Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12); but commercial-value agents are typically the more complex ones, conflicting with criterion 1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:65:Per master brief §12 / Ultraplan §10 row #2 (the four-risks-that-kill-v1.0 table), the **documented v1.0 scope-cut contingency** is verbatim:
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:90:Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:96:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:99:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Internal sales tool per Product Spec §2.2 R13 ("Not on the customer pricing card"). Drives qualified discovery-call pipeline. Demoable to a prospect but not the closing demo. Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target: "≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:109:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 513 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — the Bullhorn MCP work is rate-limiting per Ultraplan §8.1 line 514 ("Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build"). One MCP server (Bullhorn) + Companies House for enrichment. Single primary output (cleanup report) but with continuous nightly cron pattern |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:110:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:111:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:112:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:122:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 526 estimate **M (1 week)**. Webhook-driven not always-on. Structured-field mapping is per-firm config not code per Ultraplan §8.1 line 526. Tacit-note extraction is the hard part per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 ("Start with a small taxonomy (5-10 tacit-note types) and expand") |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:126:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:127:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:129:**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:135:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium-High** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 541 estimate **L (2 weeks)**. Three accounting integrations (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage — one per tenant per Ultraplan §8.1 line 537). Open Banking auth complexity (90-day token rotation per Ultraplan §8.1 line 542 gotcha). Tier 1 always-on (cortextOS Primitive 1 dependency) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:136:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First Tier-1 always-on agent** — exercises cortextOS **Primitive 1** (persistent PTY/PM2, flagged "shipped but flaky" in cortextos-primitive-status.md). First exercise of **Primitive 4** (approval gates) for chase email auto-send per master brief §8.2 line 604. First exercise of **Primitive 5** (Telegram approval surface) for FD-tier approval flow. **Does NOT touch Bullhorn** — independent integration path per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.2 (Cash Conductor uses Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking, not Bullhorn) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:137:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #1** (cortextOS primitives 1, 4, 5 — the three flagged "shipped but flaky" per cortextos-primitive-status.md). Critical gate for the v1.0 always-on agents that follow (Concierge) — if Cash Conductor surfaces primitive flakiness, the v1.0 scope-cut contingency (Ultraplan §10 row #1: degraded-mode fallback) activates before Concierge invests 4 weeks |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:140:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth (one of, per tenant) + Open Banking auth (TrueLayer/Plaid UK per Ultraplan §8.1 line 539). Chase-cadence config per tenant. FD's mobile for Telegram approval per Ultraplan §8.1 line 540 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:142:**Hire-#1 anchor (per Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim):** "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)." Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking integration is the right scope for Hire #1's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 — this places Cash Conductor at W7-8 in the canonical sequence.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:150:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 554 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — multi-source aggregation logic is the work. Four data sources (Bullhorn read + LinkedIn via Proxycurl + Reed.co.uk + CV-Library). Bounded output (5-15 candidates per query per Ultraplan §8.1 line 552). Tier 2 request-response |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library. Source-abstraction layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 designed to be reusable by Night Sourcer v1.1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:159:### 2.6 — A6 Concierge
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:163:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High complexity (Low simplicity)** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 568 estimate **XL (4 weeks)** — biggest v1.0 agent. Lifecycle state machine across 24+ months of candidate post-placement (week-1 / month-1 / month-3 / month-6 / month-12 / month-24 nurture per Product Spec §2.2 R7). Six-plus comms types (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, multi-stage check-ins) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:164:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Maximum** | **All** of cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 exercised. **First exercise of Primitive 2** (71-hour context rotation per Day 1 cortextos-primitive-status.md) — Concierge holds long-running state across 24+ months of candidate lifecycle. First Bullhorn webhook exercise per Day 2 §4.2 (with 5-minute polling fallback). Per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4: reads Candidate, ClientCorporation, JobOrder, Placement, Note + writes Note, Candidate state-fields, Placement state-fields |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:165:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High (secondary)** | Second Tier-1 always-on agent (after Cash Conductor at W7-8) — provides Risk #1 secondary exercise. Exercises Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps per Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 verbatim ("Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks") |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:184:W7-8: Cash Conductor (A4) — Hire-#1-anchored per Ultraplan §9 line 766
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:186:W10-13: Concierge (A6)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:197:- Risk #5 final reduction (all 5 bundles render cleanly) waits for Concierge W10-13.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:198:- Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps surface only at Concierge W10-13 (Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 caveat).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:200:**Cost if deferred risk materialises late:** if Bullhorn webhook coverage is worse than expected (Risk #2 secondary), Concierge polling cadence increases (per Day 2 §4.2 fallback) — connector-internal change, no agent rework. Bounded.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:202:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Excellent.** Cash Conductor at W7-8 matches Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim. Hire #1 (assumed W7) takes Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work as first sprint — well-scoped, independent of the Bullhorn track founder has been driving solo W3-W6.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:208:W5-8: Concierge (A6) — front-load the flagship (XL/4 weeks)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:215:**Why this ordering:** Get the flagship demoable agent (Concierge) live earliest to accelerate first-pilot conversion per Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:220:2. **Risk #1 derisk pushed to W12-13.** Cash Conductor's Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 first-exercise happens after Concierge's 4-week XL build. If Risk #1 materialises at W12-13, the entire v1.0 production-critical surface is at risk with no Hire-#1-takeover slot for Cash Conductor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:221:3. **Hire-#1 anchor broken.** Cash Conductor at W12-13 means Hire #1 (W7 start) has nothing to take on for 5 weeks. Hire #1's first sprint becomes "help with Concierge" — wrong scope for an onboarding sprint (Concierge is XL and founder-led).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:223:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Bad.** Structural conflict with Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:230:W6-9: Concierge (A6) — Risk #1 derisk via Tier-1 + Primitive 2 first exercise
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:236:**Why this ordering:** Front-load risk-de-risking by building Concierge (the most Primitive-heavy agent) early. Cash Conductor's Risk #1 exercise becomes redundant if Concierge already exercises Primitives 1+2+4+5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:240:1. **Concierge depends on Scribe** for Notes-for-context (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 — Concierge reads Notes Scribe wrote). Building Concierge at W6-9 before Scribe (W10) means Concierge's first-month operation has empty Note context. Materially degrades the Tier-1 always-on demo.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:253:| 2. Substrate exercise (sequential build-up) | **Wins** — each agent extends the substrate of the prior (renderer → Bullhorn auth → voice → Tier-1 primitives → multi-source → full Tier-1 lifecycle) | Loses — Concierge has to build its own Bullhorn auth + voice substrate inline | Loses — Concierge built before its substrate dependencies (Scribe's Notes-for-context not yet available) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:267:| **Risk #4 materialises (Hire #1 doesn't start)** → drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo | **Coherent.** Founder solo through W6-Scribe; W7-8 Cash Conductor becomes founder solo work (slows but doesn't block); Sourcing Scout + Concierge cut. v1.0 ships as 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 Risk #4 contingency | Incoherent. Concierge already W5-8 — can't be cut without rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge already W6-9 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:269:**Alpha is the only sequence that survives both documented contingencies cleanly.** Beta and Gamma each forces a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:275:**This section ratifies master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §9 lines 717-801 as the v1.0 sequence of record.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:294:The Hire-#1 anchor at W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766 is load-bearing — Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work is well-scoped for Hire #1's first sprint. Beta and Gamma both displace Cash Conductor past W7-8 (W12-13 and W11 respectively), leaving Hire #1 with no first-sprint scope per §3.2 and §3.3 structural defects.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:310:- **Activation:** v1.0 scope cut from 6 to 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 row #4 — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1; founder solo through end of v1.0.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:23:**Sub-decision C — v1.0 endpoint surface.** Which Bullhorn endpoints each of the v1.0 agents (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge — see §1.2) reads and writes, the cadence (real-time webhook vs scheduled poll vs ad-hoc request-response), and the rate-limit budget allocation. Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:27:Master brief §12 Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) — "Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week" — names this as one of the four risks that could kill v1.0. Tripwire: "End of week 3 status not 'core read endpoints working'" (master brief §12 row #2, Ultraplan §10 row #2). The mitigation is "Week 0 Day 2 on Bullhorn auth research" — i.e. this document. Without Sub-decisions A and B answered, Week 1 cannot begin scaffolding `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/` because the connector's authentication path determines its scope and shape.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:62:- **What ATS the first design partner uses.** If the first signed pilot is on Vincere or Voyager Infinity instead of Bullhorn, Sub-decision C's endpoint surface (and the Janitor / Concierge build order) needs revisiting per master brief §6 Day 2 Sub-decision and Ultraplan §9.1 sequencing.

The endpoint surface required by the four Bullhorn-touching v1.0 agents (Janitor R+W, Scribe W, Sourcing Scout R, Concierge R+W per §1.2) is fully addressable via documented direct-API REST endpoints — barring a commercially-gated discovery in §1.3 conversation that contradicts this.

Lazy refresh on 401 alone is insufficient for two reasons: (a) it would cause every 10-minute window's first call to take a refresh round-trip's worth of latency, breaking sub-second SLAs on Concierge real-time paths; (b) 401 detection on burst writes (Scribe's per-call sequence of 5-15 REST writes) means burst-mid-flight refresh failures lose write ordering.

Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:79:**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (ii); Risk #2 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Sub-decisions A + B (currently Proposed pending Sunday/Monday commercial conversations — which themselves have not happened due to design-partner-pipeline gap).

A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:97:**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (iii); master brief §12 Risk #4 (Hire #1 mitigation calls for scope cut from 6 → 4 agents but explicitly warns against further cuts).

docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:75:**The rule (Ultraplan §3.4):** if you need something CortexOS doesn't have, contribute it upstream. Don't fork. The exception is anything recruitment-vertical-specific — that stays in your layer.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:119:This is Ultraplan §11, restated as a Claude Code work plan. Each day is a session or two of Claude Code. End every day by committing what you have.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:190:## The five rules (Ultraplan §1 — non-negotiable)
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:195:5. Honest signal before optimistic projection — the risk register (Ultraplan §10) is the truth-telling instrument.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:203:See `docs/PATTERN-REFERENCE.md` and Ultraplan §4. Every agent has exactly:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:221:The single most important Day-1 task. Per Ultraplan §11, write `docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md` with one line per primitive:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:239:**The Ultraplan assumes primitives 1, 4, 5 are working at v1.0 start; 2, 3, 6, 7 may land during the build window.** Your audit either confirms this or triggers a re-cut of §9 of the Ultraplan.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:241:Also Day 1: have your first design-partner sales conversation. The Ultraplan §10 risk register lists "no signed LOI by end of week 0" as a v1.0-killer risk. Sales conversations start now.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:245:Per Ultraplan §11, decide and document in `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:253:Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's assumption: **close the first three pilots fastest**. That means Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before Triage absorbs the development heat. Revise only if a hire's signed or a different pilot dynamic emerges.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:259:Provision the production Hetzner UK VPS per Ultraplan §5.1 / §5.2:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:272:`docs/auto-send-safety-policy.md` (Q11 from the Ultraplan's source Q&A):
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:299:The single-sentence test (Ultraplan §12):
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:308:Update `.agents/current-priorities.md`. Update Ultraplan §10 risk register with anything new. Commit.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:324:Per the user memory and Ultraplan §4.4, every agent is built in isolation before integration. The pattern for any new agent:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:359:- Picking which agent to build next — that's the Ultraplan §9 sprint plan and depends on pilot conversations
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:367:If you ever want to see what `/onboarding` does, run it inside `~/cortextos` in a sandbox session — but don't commit any of its output. The Intel Force OS repo has its own onboarding shape (per Business Plan §5.4 / Ultraplan §5.5) which is what you build into the wizard at v1.0.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:373:Per Ultraplan §9, v1.0 ships six agents in the Starter and Boutique tiers. In order:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:382:| 6 | **Concierge** | 10–13 | Bullhorn + Microsoft Graph + AgentMail | First Tier 1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:384:After Concierge ships, the first pilot converts to paid (Week 14 milestone). v1.1 then layers Triage, Brief Decoder, Competitor Interception, Night Sourcer, and the Temp agents T5 + T3.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:386:**Do not build out of order.** The Ultraplan §9 sequence is deliberate: Diagnostic before Janitor because Diagnostic needs no Bullhorn, and Bullhorn is the critical path. Janitor before Scribe because Janitor is a one-shot batch (easier first agent) and Scribe is webhook-driven (harder runtime integration). Cash Conductor in week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (per user memory — verify, don't assume).
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:415:These are Ultraplan §1. Pin them above your desk:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:421:5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — when something doesn't work, log it and re-plan. The risk register in Ultraplan §10 is the truth-telling instrument; updated weekly, by name, with no hedging.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:431:- **Decision logging is required** (Ultraplan §4.2 change 2). Every agent run writes three log entries via `hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, `hh_decision_action`. Missing calls = hard fail in validate.sh. This is what enables the per-tenant LoRA pipeline at v2.0.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:434:- **You are not allowed to market 99.9% uptime.** The honest number is 99.5% and the customer agreement says so (Ultraplan §3.5).
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:448:| "Let me skip the test fixtures for now..." | Ultraplan §4.3 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:449:| "Let me build Triage first because it's the most exciting..." | Ultraplan §9 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:451:| "Let me ship without the kill criterion documented..." | Ultraplan §11 Day 5 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:469:That's it. The system from there is just doing the work, one day at a time, against the Ultraplan §11 checklist and then the §9 sprint plan.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:119:#### R7. The Concierge — no candidate ghosted, no client check-in missed
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:184:#### T1. Onboarding Concierge — contractor onboarding done right, once
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:243:| **Boutique** (5–10 fee earners) | £1,495 | Janitor, Scribe, Triage (auto-send), Concierge, Sourcing Scout (daytime), Cash Conductor, Client Hunter (digest) | "2–4 additional placements/year from never-lost candidates. £40k–£80k of working capital unlocked via faster cash. 20+ hours/week of operational time back." |
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:297:The story for the customer: **"Every agent makes every other agent smarter. The Scribe captures your senior consultant's judgement → the Concierge writes in that judgement's voice → the Client Hunter pitches BD using that judgement's framing → the Pulse watches relationships through that judgement's lens. After 6 months, the system writes in your firm's voice better than your second-best consultant does."**
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:398:| 1 | Persistent PTY via PM2 — agent process pre-loaded with firm voice, ATS state, recent context | Triage, Concierge, Pulse, Watchtower, Cash Conductor |
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:399:| 2 | 71-hour context rotation with auto-restart | Concierge (cross-week candidate conversations), Watchtower (per-contractor state), Pulse (multi-source watching) |
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:400:| 3 | Inter-agent file bus — agents hand work to each other via shared directories | Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge handoff; Triage → specialist-agent routing |
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:401:| 4 | Approval gates with standing authorisations | Every agent that auto-sends — Triage, Concierge, Cash Conductor, Competitor Interception |
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:475:- Concierge (Solo drafts-only, Boutique auto-send)
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:502:- T1 Onboarding Concierge
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:528:7. **Concierge** — "No candidate ghosted, no client check-in missed, every comms in your voice."
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:534:13. **T1 Onboarding Concierge** — "First 2 weeks of every contract done correctly, every time."

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:555:payload.policy_version_sha field. Material changes to tier classification
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:596:| 1 | Formal `action_type` taxonomy enum — should this live in autosend-policy.yaml only, or also in a typed schema for tools.yaml validation? | §3 + §4 | Defer to ADR-005 in Week 1; recommend typed enum in JSON Schema mirrored to YAML |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:630:**For Week 0 remaining.** Day 6 (vertical schema v0.1) and Day 7 (single-sentence test + Codex run) do not depend on this policy directly. Day 7's question 1 (design partner LOI) is the structural Week-0 gate; this policy supports a future LOI by providing the auto-send liability framework needed in the pilot agreement (§10).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:632:**For Week 1-2.** The `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` Week-1 prerequisite (per ADR-002 §"For Week 1 work" + ADR-003 Decision 3) now has its `hh_decision_action` specification. Implementation work is well-defined: §4 pseudocode + §5 escalation payloads + §7 audit row schema.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:658:- v1.0 implementation prerequisite: this policy + the Week-1 `_shared/` helpers + ADR-003 renderer + Day-4 Postgres schema (all four are present after this commit lands).

docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:52:- Authored as a separate W4 ADR (number to be assigned at W4-polish authoring time; this ADR does NOT pre-assign a number) together with the schema supplements that define its payload key + per-tenant config field
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:56:**Rule 2 (Schema before code) satisfied:** the schema work for the per-claim quality metric (payload key + per-tenant config field) lands in the future W4 ADR's supplements before any code reads/writes those fields. This ADR-006 does NOT introduce schema fields; it only specifies Gate A as per-section hard-fail.
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:119:- Sample rate configurable per tenant via field landing in v0.3 vertical-schema supplement (concrete field name + type specified there, not in this ADR)
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:127:- `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` Phase 4 Cat-ζ section → references ADR-006 as the closure mechanism (already cross-referenced in commit `1f8c92f`)
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:160:2. **`bullhorn_field_backfill` unregistered, would fail-safe to red:** my flag-for-addition framing didn't satisfy because `hook-helpers.sh::autosend_policy_lookup` fails to red on unknown action types AT RUNTIME, regardless of flag prose. Real bug requires either (a) policy row added BEFORE ratification, OR (b) explicit "blocked W5 prerequisite" framing not "executable output."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:162:4. **Schema field names STILL wrong:** my Round-4-v2 fix touched `headcount_band → size_employees` but missed `client.legal_name → name`, `registered_office_address` (doesn't exist; canonical is `address` per line 248), `sic_codes` (doesn't exist as canonical field). Schema audit was incomplete.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:174:3. Founder approves: (a) catalogue extensions (escalation-codes + autosend-policy batch additions), (b) schema field corrections, (c) §5/§6/§7 prose standardisation pattern (15 min)
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:188:1. Gate B composite score (≥12.5) weakens dual ULTRAPLAN thresholds (15% dedup AND 10% field-completeness independently)
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:189:2. `recent_edit` schema confusion — it's a v0.2 separate table, not a decision_log field
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:190:3. Schema field references — candidate has `bullhorn_id` not "CRN"; location line number 124 not 89

   150	- Day 5 autosend policy: estimated 300-500 lines; actual 648. **+30% to +116% overshoot.**
   151	- Day 6 vertical schema: estimated 300-500; actual 899. **+80% to +200% overshoot.**
   152	
   153	Both were defensible (the depth was needed) but the estimates were systematically optimistic. The fix is per-unit calibration.
   154	
   155	### §4.1 — Per-unit-line-budget table
   156	
   157	Use this as the estimate basis for future drafts:
   158	
   159	| Artefact type | Per-unit | Line budget | Examples |
   160	|---|---|---|---|
   161	| **ADR** | Per decision | 50-80 lines | ADR-001 (Decision 1 + 2 + Consequences ≈ 200 lines for 3 decisions) |
   162	| **Reference doc** | Per mechanism / section | 60-100 lines | vault-concurrency.md (4 mechanisms ≈ 400 lines + headers) |
   163	| **Runbook** | Per executable section | 80-150 lines (incl. commands + verification) | day-4-provisioning.md (12 sections ≈ 1200 lines) |
   164	| **Decision artefact** | Per tier/trigger/option × support | 30-60 lines (incl. examples + escalation) | autosend-safety-policy.md (4 tiers + 29 action_types + 3 ESC codes + 11 sections ≈ 650 lines) |
   165	| **Schema (YAML)** | Per entity / relationship | 40-60 lines (incl. fields + notes) | vertical-schema.yaml (8 entities × ~50 lines + 10 relationships × 10 lines + matrices + 12 questions ≈ 900 lines) |
   166	| **Header + footer overhead** | Per artefact | +30-50 lines | Standard frontmatter + closing |
   167	
   168	### §4.2 — Estimate methodology
   169	
   170	1. Count sub-units (decisions, mechanisms, sections, tiers, entities, etc.)
   171	2. Multiply by per-unit budget from §4.1
   172	3. Add 20% overhead for headers, cross-references, open questions
   173	4. Round to nearest 100
   174	
   175	**Day-6 retrospective check:** vertical-schema.yaml estimated 300-500. Per §4.1: 8 entities × 50 = 400 lines, 10 relationships × 10 = 100 lines, agent matrix + Bullhorn mapping + open questions + versioning = ~200 lines, header overhead = ~50 lines. **True estimate: 750 lines.** Actual: 899. ±20% range: [600, 900]. **Actual is within range.** The Day-6 estimate was the wrong number, not the work.
   176	
   177	### §4.3 — Trim discipline before commit
   178	
   179	If first-draft length exceeds calibrated estimate by >20%:
   180	
   181	1. Stop. Identify the bloat — usually one of three:
   182	   - **Redundant cross-references** (same fact restated in multiple sections)
   183	   - **Verbose examples** (10-line examples that could be 3 lines)
   184	   - **Defensive notes** (footnotes that aren't load-bearing)
   185	2. Trim before commit OR commit with explicit acknowledgment that depth-needed-equals-length-shipped + rationale in commit message
   186	3. If founder accepts overshoot: that's a calibration update (§4.1 per-unit budget gets revised upward), not a discipline failure
   187	
   188	**A-grade test:** estimates within ±20% of actual. When overshoot happens, it's a known/documented choice, not a surprise.
   189

   192	## §5 — Citation accuracy: pre-write verification
   193	
   194	**Rule:** Every `§X.Y` reference, every line number, every numerical claim is verified against source *before* being written into an artefact, not after-the-fact in review.
   195	
   196	### §5.1 — Pre-write verification checklist
   197	
   198	Before writing any citation:
   199	
   200	1. **`§X.Y` references:** open the source document. Verify the section exists and contains what you're about to claim.
   201	2. **`line N` references:** open the source document at that line. Verify it matches.
   202	3. **Numerical claims:** count. "29 action_types" not "30+". "10 entity_links" not "~10". If counting is hard, write the counting query (grep, wc -l, SQL) and run it.
   203	4. **Cross-references:** when citing `<artefact>.md §X.Y`, verify both the artefact exists and §X.Y exists within it. Path drifts and renamed sections are common.
   204	
   205	### §5.2 — Pre-commit citation audit (for new artefacts)
   206	
   207	Before commit, run a citation grep across the artefact:
   208	
   209	```bash
   210	# Find all §-references
   211	grep -nE "§[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*" <artefact>
   212	
   213	# Find all line-N references
   214	grep -nE "line [0-9]+" <artefact>
   215	
   216	# Find all numerical-claim patterns
   217	grep -nE "\b[0-9]+ (entities|fields|action_types|relationships|triggers|tiers|sections|edits|items)" <artefact>
   218	```
   219	
   220	For each match, verify against source. Fix any drift before commit.

docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:3:**Status:** In force (Day 6, 2026-05-18). All sections from Week 0 onwards reference this document at section-gate moments.
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:12:Days 0-6 self-grade on Week-0 retrospective (Day-6 evening):
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:284:Day-5 autosend policy §3 + §10 cited `bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.1` as the canonical-orange anchor for Concierge `bullhorn_note_customer_visible`. Verified §4.1 establishes the action exists but does not explicitly frame as sensitive auto-send. Sensitivity framing lives in §6.3 ("Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI").
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:329:| 2 | Should §4.1 per-unit-line-budget table get its own per-week revision as new artefact types emerge? | Yes; track in this doc. Update after each new artefact type ships (e.g., when first agent bundle ships in Week 3-4, add "Agent bundle" row with calibrated budget). |
docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:330:| 3 | Should §5 citation discipline be enforced via pre-commit hook (mechanical grep + verify)? | Defer to Week 1-2. Hook would be valuable but is itself code-to-write. v1.0: discipline is mental; v1.1+: tool-enforced. |
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:46:The five rules in §1 govern every decision. The boundary in §3 governs every file. The Week 0 list in §6 is the only thing to do this week. Read all three before writing any agent code.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:105:1. **There is no `templates/agent-codex` directory on `main` today.** I previously implied Codex-runtime agent templates ship with cortextos. They don't. The `runtime` field discussion exists in some forks/PRs but is not in the published v0.1.1. **Consequence:** the Codex ratification loop in §10 runs Codex CLI as an **external tool**, not as a cortextOS agent runtime. We can revisit if/when codex-app-server lands upstream.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:279:| `.agents/current-priorities.md` | What we're doing this week | `Week 0: clear the §6 checklist` |

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:436:### Day 0 (today) — repo reconciliation
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:441:- [ ] Create `.agents/current-priorities.md`: single line `Week 0: clear the §6 checklist`
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:446:The single most important Week 0 task.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:454:- [ ] If audit reveals primitives 1, 4, or 5 are NOT working today → re-cut Ultraplan §9 sprint plan tomorrow
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:464:- [ ] **Brain UI scope decision.** Per §5.5 (post-ADR-002 Edit 2 atomic correction): v1.0 ships the parallel `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` wrappers + `wiki/lib/*.ts` modules + Postgres tables + pgvector voice index — **no Brain UI yet**. v1.1 adds the today-view + backlinks panel + wiki-find UI; v1.2 adds the graph view. **Confirm this in `docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md`** — or document the deviation.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:489:2. Does the CortexOS submodule give us primitives 1, 4, and 5 working today?
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:494:**Five yeses → Week 1 starts Monday. Anything less → Week 0 extends.**
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:502:The v1 codebase at `~/code/intel-force-os/` and the `legacy/v1/` mirror in the v2 repo contain a usable scaffold — but it predates cortextOS and the recruitment vertical. The instinct to "start fresh" is right. Several pieces are still valuable; we harvest them with structural adjustments.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:589:Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:768:After Week 0:
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:771:- Weekly ratification of risk register changes (informal — 5 min spot-check)
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:811:> Then read `.agents/current-priorities.md` and propose the concrete plan for today.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:839:Verbatim from Ultraplan §10. Full register at `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`, weekly updates.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:844:| 2 | Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week | End of week 3 status not "core read endpoints working" | Pre-emptive: Week 0 day 2 on Bullhorn auth research. Contingency: defer Janitor and Scribe to weeks 7–8, push Concierge to v1.1 |
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:845:| 3 | First design partner not signed by end of Week 0 | Week 0 ends without LOI | Sales conversations start before Week 0. Do NOT begin agent code until first LOI lands. |

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:913:4. Propose today's plan
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:958:> Then read `.agents/current-priorities.md` and propose the concrete plan for today. We are on Week 0; today's task is whichever Day in §6 we're on. **Do not write any agent code until Week 0 is cleared per the §6 Day 7 test.**
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:968:- Skip Week 0 because "we've already started building"

docs/decisions/ADR-004-renderer-implementation-deviations.md:72:**Observation:** `cortextos-ifos list-agents` (which calls into `packages/harness/cortextos/src/bus/agents.ts` `listAgents()`) scans `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/*` and treats every immediate directory child as an agent. `_shared/` sits in that location per ADR-003 §3.3.3 Option γ. Result: `_shared` appears in the list-agents output as if it were an agent named `_shared` in org `<tenant>`, with no display name + no config + status `stopped`.
docs/decisions/ADR-004-renderer-implementation-deviations.md:74:**Decision:** **Accept as upstream limitation.** Do NOT modify the renderer to relocate `_shared/` outside the scanned directory. The placement matches ADR-003's design intent (one canonical `_shared/` per org reachable by all agents via relative symlink). Renderer correctness is unaffected — the daemon's own `discoverAndStart()` doesn't try to launch `_shared` because it has no `config.json`; PM2 + agent-manager skip it cleanly. Only the cosmetic `list-agents` output is affected.

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:571:- **No daemon notification.** The renderer writes to disk; the cortextOS daemon's existing `discoverAndStart()` polling picks up new agents on next daemon start (or via `cortextos-ifos enable <agent>` IPC). For brand-new agents the renderer's stdout prints: `Render complete. To activate: pm2 restart ifos-daemon`. For re-renders of existing agents, stdout prints: `Render complete. To pick up new config: cortextos-ifos bus self-restart <agent>`.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:598:- **Refuse if target exists:** rejected because re-renders are the dominant flow — every per-tenant config edit triggers a re-render. A `--force` flag on every invocation is friction without benefit. The §5.1 non-rendered-target check covers the dangerous case (accidental overwrite of a `cortextos-ifos add-agent` scaffold); that's the actual risk.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:604:3. If `bundle_sha` matches AND the rendered output's marker file timestamp matches AND `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` mtime hasn't changed AND `agents/_shared/` SHA matches the org's last-snapshot SHA:
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:605:   - Renderer exits 0 with stdout: `No-op: bundle, tenant config, and shared helpers unchanged since last render.`
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:609:This makes re-runs cheap and accurate. A founder editing only `agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md` and re-rendering all tenants gets a no-op on tenants whose config hasn't moved, and a real render on tenants whose `_config.yaml` was touched.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:632:**Detection:** Renderer runs Ajv (or equivalent JSON Schema validator) against `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` materialised through the schema's `allOf $ref` resolution chain. Validation fails on missing required fields, type mismatches, or unrecognised keys (`additionalProperties: false`).
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:636:**Recovery:** stderr lists the failed validation path (e.g. `properties.nurture_cadence.post_interview_chase_hours: expected integer, got string`). Founder edits `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` or the `config.schema.json` source (rare; schema edits go through Codex ratification per master brief §10.5). Re-runs render.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:652:**Detection:** Renderer checks `agents/recruitment/<name>/` exists; lists files; verifies all six required files from §1.1 are present (README.md, agent.md, config.schema.json, tools.yaml, validate.sh, context.sh).
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:662:**Detection:** `/vault/<tenant>/` doesn't exist OR `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` is missing.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:125:**The spec gap.** The cortextOS daemon's `AgentManager.discoverAndStart()` (Primitive 1 evidence, `src/daemon/agent-manager.ts:47-78`) bootstraps agents from `${projectRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` with a cortextOS-shaped layout (`config.json`, `.env`, `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, etc.). The IFOS Agent Bundle v2 lives at a different path with a different shape. **Master brief §8 does not specify how the v2 bundle becomes a runnable cortextOS agent.** There is no "renderer" that translates the bundle into a cortextOS-compatible directory. This is a real spec gap and goes in the "Spec gaps surfaced" section at the end of this design.

    63	Bullhorn entity inferred from call participants + tenant Bullhorn lookup:
    64	- 1:1 call with candidate → Candidate entity update
    65	- 1:1 call with client contact → Contact entity update
    66	- Briefing call (consultant + client) → Brief entity update
    67	- Placement check-in (consultant + placed candidate) → Placement entity update
    68	- Opportunity scoping (consultant + prospect) → Opportunity entity update
    69	
    70	Minimum 3 fields extracted per call (Gate A). Canonical fields by entity (names per `vertical-schema.yaml` v0.1 + v0.2):
    71	
    72	| Entity | Canonical fields (schema-verified) |
    73	|---|---|
    74	| Candidate | `location`, `current_role_title`, `notice_period_weeks`, `salary_expectation_min` + `salary_expectation_max`, `employment_type` (perm/contract/hybrid), `key_skills` (list) |
    75	| Contact | `seniority`, `decision_authority` (enum: yes/no/influencer/blocker/unknown per Q5 v0.1), `preferred_channel`, `next_action_target_date` |
    76	| Brief | `salary_min` + `salary_max`, `start_date`, `role_type`, `must_haves` (list), `nice_to_haves` (list), `deal_breakers` (list) |
    77	| Placement | `start_date`, `placement_status`, `week_1_status_note` (free-text), `satisfaction_signal` (enum) |
    78	| Opportunity | `sector`, `headcount_growth_signal_text`, `hiring_velocity_band`, `decision_window_text` |
    79	
    80	Field names match canonical schema verbatim; some v0.1 fields (e.g. `headcount_growth_signal_text`, `satisfaction_signal`, `week_1_status_note`) are scheduled for v0.3 supplement at W6 build start — flagged here as pre-build references requiring schema-supplement landing before Scribe references them in `cycle.sh`. The Q1 verification pass (W6 Day 1) audits all field names against the schema as it exists then.
    81	
    82	Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='scribe'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='bullhorn_scribe_field_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes confidence per field + transcript timestamp anchors.

   336	    notes:
   337	      - v1.0 is intentionally thin — only the fields Concierge addressee-resolution needs for orange-tier sends.
   338	      - v1.1 Triage expands: structured decision-authority (budget tier, decision domain, escalation chain), engagement history aggregate, preferred-channel sentiment.

1. Internal contradiction in the Scribe access notes. Lines 247-250 say Scribe writes `contact.decision_authority` and `brief.start_date`, but line 292 says `decision_authority` is explicitly NOT written by Scribe, and lines 675-678 admit `brief.start_date` is not canonical and should be `start_date_target`. This violates schema-before-code and honest-signal discipline. Fix the §2 change notes and matrix comments to name only schema-backed fields, using `start_date_target` if that is the intended field.

2. Confidence-like payload fields are not bounded or validated. Lines 514-524 define `per_claim_confidence_distribution.mean_confidence` and above/below-confidence counts, while the migration states the `decision_log.payload` extension needs no migration because JSONB accepts arbitrary keys. The schema-change skill requires confidence-like `[0.0, 1.0]` values to have an explicit CHECK/trigger or equivalent validation. Add range metadata to the supplement and enforce it in the companion migration or mandatory decision-log writer validation.

3. Invoice retention claims are not backed by an executable mechanism. Lines 415-418 state `cash_conductor_invoices` has 7-year pseudonymization and cancelled/voided rows are retained 90d, but the companion migration only creates the table and grants SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, with no purge/pseudonymization trigger, job, or cited runbook. This is optimistic projection for PII-bearing structured state. Either mark retention enforcement as gated/future with an explicit blocker, or add/cite the purge implementation and migration support.
