=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Janitor — the wedge agent

**Status:** Proposed.
**Build state:** Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fixes applied. R11 closed Gate A ESC routing + recent_edit citation + v0.3 supplement §2a authority. R12 added schema declaration for `janitor_dedup_threshold` + `janitor_last_run` in v0.3 supplement §4. R19 fixes (2026-05-25): autosend-policy citation, contractor dedup scope alignment, Step 8 audit row, ESC_GATE_B_MISS catalogue alignment. Awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice.
**Reading-discipline note (added 2026-06-03 per Codex Fbis-R3 closure pattern + CC + Concierge precedent):** this `agent.md` is the **CONTRACT** that the W6-7 build slice implements against. The 6 sibling bundle files (`cycle.sh` + `validate.sh` + `context.sh` + `cleanup.sh` + `tools.yaml`) + 3 fixtures EXIST AS SCAFFOLD (landed across commits `1efe9a6` + `36d1fff` + `96ae47d` + `66d1a6d` + `0837b94` per W5 Day-31); they carry `TODO(W6-7)` markers throughout that the W6-7 build slice replaces with live implementation matching the contract below. **Audit-row signatures + workflow steps documented below describe the CONTRACT shape; current SKELETON cycle.sh emits only the minimal trigger/output markers (`session_start`, `bullhorn_auth_refresh`, `mode_routed`, `bullhorn_entity_scan`, `dedup_candidate_pass`, `dedup_contractor_pass`, `field_completeness_audit`, `companies_house_enrichment`, `linkedin_enrichment_skipped`, `tacit_note_harvest`, `bullhorn_write_batch`, `day_30_report`, `operator_notify_telegram`, `janitor_run_complete`) listed at `cycle.sh` lines 105, 134, 144, 159, 175, 185, 196, 205, 220, 232, 252, 273, 289, 297.** The yellow-tier audit rows the contract names (`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` + `bullhorn_field_backfill` + `bullhorn_note_attach`) are NOT yet emitted at runtime — they're the W6-7 contract surface, not current behavior. The SKELETON `context.sh` uses **env-var fallbacks** today (`IFOS_FORCE_BULLHORN_CORPORATION_ID`, `IFOS_FORCE_JANITOR_DEDUP_THRESHOLD`, `IFOS_FORCE_OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) even though the v0.4 schema supplement LANDED 2026-06-03 (commit `a1bbcf6` + LIVE on VPS) made the canonical `SELECT config->>'<key>' FROM tenant_adapters` path schema-clean for all three — that wiring lands at W6-7 alongside the `@ifos/bullhorn` refresh integration. Don't read agent.md as a description of running code; read it as the spec the W6-7 build slice implements.
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.2 (lines 105-116; §2.1 is the Diagnostic section).

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate AND contractor records (separate entity types per vertical-schema.yaml §1; same fuzzy-matcher per §4 Steps 3-4), (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `recent_edit.resolution='approved_after_edit'` rows (v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access). Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). Auto-band Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` runtime (policy rationale at `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md`) — sampled spot-checks, no synchronous approval; review-band dedup merges (0.70–0.85 confidence, or ≥0.85 with Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days) are instead held for synchronous Telegram approval via `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` before write. Every write emits a per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`.

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Cron (v1.0)

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)

```bash
ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
```

`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold` — declared in `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions.janitor_dedup_threshold`; enforced by `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.

### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate AND contractor pairs identified this run; for each pair: entity type (candidate / contractor — separate types per vertical-schema.yaml §1), `bullhorn_id`, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (auto-merged ≥0.85 / approval-gated 0.70–0.85 via ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED / dropped <0.70) |
| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `recent_edit` table rows with `resolution='approved_after_edit'` (per v0.2-supplement.yaml recent_edit definition; v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access); attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | TWO independent thresholds per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. Both must pass. NOT a composite score — that would let one threshold cover for the other. |
| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |

### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)

Three write categories. Action types map to existing entries in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` (all three below are already registered there as yellow-tier):

1. **Candidate / contractor merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade; candidate and contractor are separate entity types per vertical-schema.yaml §1 but share the §4 Steps 3-4 fuzzy-matcher) — auto-merged only when confidence ≥0.85 AND neither record had Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim); pairs in the 0.70–0.85 review band, or ≥0.85 with recent activity, are held for synchronous Telegram approval via `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` before any write. Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** with `payload.entity_type ∈ {candidate, contractor}` discriminating the two — reused rather than a separate contractor action_type (same yellow tier + matcher; registered in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` under §YELLOW action_types; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 124), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

---

## §4 — Workflow

12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")

1. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run — declared in vertical-schema
     v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions.janitor_last_run;
     enforced by migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5 validator allowlist)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT catalogue §2.5 standard handling)

3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)

4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)

5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 124),
     client.industry (line 238), client.size_employees (line 243),
     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   → identify missing-field rows
   → batch enrichment calls
   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")

6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429

7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
     signup commercial decision)
   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
     current_company → write back

8. Tacit-note harvest
   → query the `recent_edit` v0.2 table directly (per vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml
     recent_edit definition; v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access):
     SELECT FROM recent_edit WHERE resolved_at > now() - interval '30 days'
     AND resolution='approved_after_edit' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → join to decision_log only if action-context lookups needed
   → group by target_entity_type (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_tacit_note_harvest", "tenant:<slug>",
     "harvested:<N> rows; groups:<M> entity-types; narrative_drafts:<K>")
   → on classifier fail after retries: hh_decision_action("validate_gate_a_fail",
     "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, "ESC_VOICE_DRIFT; classifier_score:<N>")

9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff

10. Day-30 report assembly
   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")

11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")

12. Session close
   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → exit code 0 (or 1 if BOTH Gate-B thresholds missed for 3 consecutive runs per §5 + catalogue → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §4 (policy rationale; runtime YAML is `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`). Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)

Gate A failure routing by class (per catalogue §2.5):
- PII detected outside firm boundary → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall per catalogue routing)
- Tacit-note voice classifier <0.75 → `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` (warn; operator_chat_id)
- Tone-rule violations → `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION` (warn; operator_chat_id per catalogue §2.10)
- Output-shape failures (section count, write-batch size, dedup confidence below threshold for action) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)

`ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (catalogue §2.5) is NOT a Gate A failure code — per catalogue trigger it's the SUCCESS-path Telegram approval gate for dedup pairs that need human approval before merge: the 0.70–0.85 review band, plus any ≥0.85 pair where a record has Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days. Pairs ≥0.85 with no recent activity auto-merge (yellow tier, spot-check) and do NOT fire it. Sub-0.70 confidence pairs silently drop in the Step 3 algorithm; no ESC fire. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (catalogue line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.

Two independent thresholds (both must pass): dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. NOT a composite — composite would let one cover the other.

Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.

Per catalogue `escalation-codes.md` ESC_GATE_B_MISS trigger (Janitor example: "dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%"): `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` fires only when BOTH thresholds miss for 3 consecutive runs (dedup-improvement <15% AND completeness-improvement <10%) → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill). Single-threshold misses are tracked in the day-30 report (§3 Output 1 row 6) and inform tenant-level quality review but do NOT fire ESC. Sensitivity choice: strict AND-trigger reduces false alarms; tightening to OR-trigger requires a catalogue amendment + re-ratification.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

All codes are registered in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (catalogue extended to 52 codes per `2026-05-24` bilateral disposition; see disagreement-doc + `catalogue(bilateral)` commit).

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` | Per catalogue §2.5: dedup pairs needing human approval before merge — the 0.70–0.85 review band, plus ≥0.85 pairs with recent Bullhorn activity (SUCCESS path; Telegram approval gate fires). NOT a Gate A failure code. | warn | operator_chat_id (via Telegram approval gate per catalogue routing) |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Per catalogue trigger: per-agent local Gate B metric threshold missed. For Janitor: BOTH thresholds miss for 3 consecutive runs (dedup-improvement <15% AND field-completeness-improvement <10%) per catalogue `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` Janitor example. Single-threshold misses do NOT fire (per §5 Gate B). Catalogue routing: operator_chat_id | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Janitor does NOT use:

- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
- **OAuth-token revocation** — there is no separate `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` catalogue code; revocation is folded into `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` via `payload.failure_type='revoked_401'` (per concierge §6 + catalogue). Janitor fires `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` (listed above) on any refresh/revocation failure
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)

Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)

1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

     3	**Status:** Proposed.
     4	**Build state:** Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fixes applied. R11 closed Gate A ESC routing + recent_edit citation + v0.3 supplement §2a authority. R12 added schema declaration for `janitor_dedup_threshold` + `janitor_last_run` in v0.3 supplement §4. R19 fixes (2026-05-25): autosend-policy citation, contractor dedup scope alignment, Step 8 audit row, ESC_GATE_B_MISS catalogue alignment.

     5	**Reading-discipline note (added 2026-06-03 per Codex Fbis-R3 closure pattern + CC + Concierge precedent):** this `agent.md` is the **CONTRACT** that the W6-7 build slice implements against. The 6 sibling bundle files (`cycle.sh` + `validate.sh` + `context.sh` + `cleanup.sh` + `tools.yaml`) + 3 fixtures EXIST AS SCAFFOLD (landed across commits `1efe9a6` + `36d1fff` + `96ae47d` + `66d1a6d` + `0837b94` per W5 Day-31); they carry `TODO(W6-7)` markers throughout that the W6-7 build slice replaces with live implementation matching the contract below. **Audit-row signatures + workflow steps documented below describe the CONTRACT shape; current SKELETON cycle.sh emits only the minimal trigger/output markers (`session_start`, `bullhorn_auth_refresh`, `mode_routed`, `bullhorn_entity_scan`, `dedup_candidate_pass`, `dedup_contractor_pass`, `field_completeness_audit`, `companies_house_enrichment`, `linkedin_enrichment_skipped`, `tacit_note_harvest`, `bullhorn_write_batch`, `day_30_report`, `operator_notify_telegram`, `janitor_run_complete`) listed at `cycle.sh` lines 105, 134, 144, 159, 175, 185, 196, 205, 220, 232, 252, 273, 289, 297.** The yellow-tier audit rows the contract names (`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` + `bullhorn_field_backfill` + `bullhorn_note_attach`) are NOT yet emitted at runtime — they're the W6-7 contract surface, not current behavior. The SKELETON `context.sh` uses **env-var fallbacks** today (`IFOS_FORCE_BULLHORN_CORPORATION_ID`, `IFOS_FORCE_JANITOR_DEDUP_THRESHOLD`, `IFOS_FORCE_OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) even though the v0.4 schema supplement LANDED 2026-06-03 (commit `a1bbcf6` + LIVE on VPS) made the canonical `SELECT config->>'<key>' FROM tenant_adapters` path schema-clean for all three — that wiring lands at W6-7 alongside the `@ifos/bullhorn` refresh integration. Don't read agent.md as a description of running code; read it as the spec the W6-7 build slice implements.

    14	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    15	
    16	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    17	
    18	> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate AND contractor records (separate entity types per vertical-schema.yaml §1; same fuzzy-matcher per §4 Steps 3-4), (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `recent_edit.resolution='approved_after_edit'` rows (v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access). Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). Auto-band Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` runtime (policy rationale at `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md`) — sampled spot-checks, no synchronous approval; review-band dedup merges (0.70–0.85 confidence, or ≥0.85 with Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days) are instead held for synchronous Telegram approval via `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` before write. Every write emits a per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`.

    22	## §2 — Invocation surface
    23	
    24	### Cron (v1.0)
    25	
    26	```bash
    27	# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
    28	0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
    29	```
    30	
    31	Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.
    32	
    33	### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)
    34	
    35	```bash
    36	ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
    37	```
    38	
    39	`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).
    40	
    41	### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)
    42	
    43	- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API

    56	| # | Section | Content |
    57	|---|---|---|
    58	| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
    59	| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate AND contractor pairs identified this run; for each pair: entity type (candidate / contractor — separate types per vertical-schema.yaml §1), `bullhorn_id`, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (auto-merged ≥0.85 / approval-gated 0.70–0.85 via ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED / dropped <0.70) |
    60	| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
    61	| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `recent_edit` table rows with `resolution='approved_after_edit'` (per v0.2-supplement.yaml recent_edit definition; v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access); attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
    62	| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
    63	| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | TWO independent thresholds per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. Both must pass. NOT a composite score — that would let one threshold cover for the other. |
    64	| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
    65	| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |
    66	
    67	### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)
    68	
    69	Three write categories. Action types map to existing entries in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` (all three below are already registered there as yellow-tier):
    70	
    71	1. **Candidate / contractor merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade; candidate and contractor are separate entity types per vertical-schema.yaml §1 but share the §4 Steps 3-4 fuzzy-matcher) — auto-merged only when confidence ≥0.85 AND neither record had Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim); pairs in the 0.70–0.85 review band, or ≥0.85 with recent activity, are held for synchronous Telegram approval via `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` before any write. Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** with `payload.entity_type ∈ {candidate, contractor}` discriminating the two — reused rather than a separate contractor action_type (same yellow tier + matcher; registered in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` under §YELLOW action_types; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    72	2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 124), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    73	3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).
    74	
    75	Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

    79	## §4 — Workflow
    80	
    81	12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
    82	
    83	```
    84	0. Session start
    85	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
    86	     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
    87	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")
    88	
    89	1. Bullhorn auth refresh
    90	   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
    91	     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
    92	   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries
    93	
    94	2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
    95	   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
    96	     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
    97	     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run — declared in vertical-schema
    98	     v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions.janitor_last_run;
    99	     enforced by migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5 validator allowlist)
   100	   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   101	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT catalogue §2.5 standard handling)
   102	
   103	3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   104	   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   105	   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   106	   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   107	   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
   108	     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   109	   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
   110	     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)
   111	
   112	4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   113	   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
   114	     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)
   115	
   116	5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   117	   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 124),
   118	     client.industry (line 238), client.size_employees (line 243),
   119	     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
   120	     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   121	   → identify missing-field rows
   122	   → batch enrichment calls
   123	   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")
   124	
   125	6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   126	   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
   127	     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
   128	     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   129	   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   130	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429
   131	
   132	7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   133	   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
   134	     signup commercial decision)
   135	   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
   136	     current_company → write back
   137	
   138	8. Tacit-note harvest
   139	   → query the `recent_edit` v0.2 table directly (per vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml
   140	     recent_edit definition; v0.3 supplement §2a grants Janitor R access):
   141	     SELECT FROM recent_edit WHERE resolved_at > now() - interval '30 days'
   142	     AND resolution='approved_after_edit' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   143	   → join to decision_log only if action-context lookups needed
   144	   → group by target_entity_type (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   145	   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
   146	     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)
   147	   → hh_decision_output("janitor_tacit_note_harvest", "tenant:<slug>",
   148	     "harvested:<N> rows; groups:<M> entity-types; narrative_drafts:<K>")
   149	   → on classifier fail after retries: hh_decision_action("validate_gate_a_fail",
   150	     "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, "ESC_VOICE_DRIFT; classifier_score:<N>")
   151	
   152	9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   153	   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
   154	     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   155	   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   156	   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   157	   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff
   158	
   159	10. Day-30 report assembly
   160	   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
   161	     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   162	   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   163	   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   164	   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   165	   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")
   166	
   167	11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   168	   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   169	   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
   170	     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   171	   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
   172	     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")
   173	
   174	12. Session close
   175	   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   176	   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   177	   → exit code 0 (or 1 if BOTH Gate-B thresholds missed for 3 consecutive runs per §5 + catalogue → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
   178	```

   182	## §5 — Gates
   183	
   184	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   185	
   186	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §4 (policy rationale; runtime YAML is `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`). Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:
   187	
   188	- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
   189	- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
   190	- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   191	- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
   192	- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
   193	- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
   194	- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)
   195	
   196	Gate A failure routing by class (per catalogue §2.5):
   197	- PII detected outside firm boundary → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall per catalogue routing)
   198	- Tacit-note voice classifier <0.75 → `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` (warn; operator_chat_id)
   199	- Tone-rule violations → `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION` (warn; operator_chat_id per catalogue §2.10)
   200	- Output-shape failures (section count, write-batch size, dedup confidence below threshold for action) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
   201	
   202	`ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (catalogue §2.5) is NOT a Gate A failure code — per catalogue trigger it's the SUCCESS-path Telegram approval gate for dedup pairs that need human approval before merge: the 0.70–0.85 review band, plus any ≥0.85 pair where a record has Bullhorn activity in the last 90 days. Pairs ≥0.85 with no recent activity auto-merge (yellow tier, spot-check) and do NOT fire it. Sub-0.70 confidence pairs silently drop in the Step 3 algorithm; no ESC fire. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (catalogue line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.
   203	
   204	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   205	
   206	Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.
   207	
   208	Two independent thresholds (both must pass): dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. NOT a composite — composite would let one cover the other.
   209	
   210	Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.
   211	
   212	Per catalogue `escalation-codes.md` ESC_GATE_B_MISS trigger (Janitor example: "dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%"): `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` fires only when BOTH thresholds miss for 3 consecutive runs (dedup-improvement <15% AND completeness-improvement <10%) → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill). Single-threshold misses are tracked in the day-30 report (§3 Output 1 row 6) and inform tenant-level quality review but do NOT fire ESC. Sensitivity choice: strict AND-trigger reduces false alarms; tightening to OR-trigger requires a catalogue amendment + re-ratification.
   213

   215	
   216	## §6 — Escalation codes
   217	
   218	All codes are registered in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (catalogue extended to 52 codes per `2026-05-24` bilateral disposition; see disagreement-doc + `catalogue(bilateral)` commit).
   219	
   220	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   221	|---|---|---|---|
   222	| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   223	| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
   224	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
   225	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   226	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   227	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   228	| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` | Per catalogue §2.5: dedup pairs needing human approval before merge — the 0.70–0.85 review band, plus ≥0.85 pairs with recent Bullhorn activity (SUCCESS path; Telegram approval gate fires). NOT a Gate A failure code. | warn | operator_chat_id (via Telegram approval gate per catalogue routing) |
   229	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Per catalogue trigger: per-agent local Gate B metric threshold missed. For Janitor: BOTH thresholds miss for 3 consecutive runs (dedup-improvement <15% AND field-completeness-improvement <10%) per catalogue `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` Janitor example. Single-threshold misses do NOT fire (per §5 Gate B). Catalogue routing: operator_chat_id | warn | operator_chat_id |
   230	| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |
   231	
   232	Janitor does NOT use:
   233	
   234	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
   235	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
   236	- **OAuth-token revocation** — there is no separate `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` catalogue code; revocation is folded into `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` via `payload.failure_type='revoked_401'` (per concierge §6 + catalogue). Janitor fires `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` (listed above) on any refresh/revocation failure
   237	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
   238	
   239	---
   240	
   241	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   242	
   243	Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   244	
   245	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
   246	  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
   247	  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
   248	  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
   249	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
   250	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.
   251	
   252	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

The artefact is a pre-build/contract scaffold, so I’m checking its claims against schema, escalation catalogue, autosend policy, and planning docs rather than treating the skeleton bundle as production-ready.

   285	
   286	### Open questions for founder review
   287	
   288	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   289	|---|---|---|
   290	| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
   291	| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
   292	| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
   293	| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
   294	| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
   295	| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |
   296	
   297	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
   298	
   299	1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
   300	2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
   301	3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

   305	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   306	
   307	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.
   308	
   309	Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
   310	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   311	- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
   312	- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer
   313	
   314	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   315	- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   316	- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   317	- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
   318	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)
   319	
   320	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

   485	### 8.1 v1.0 agents (six)
   486	
   487	#### A1. The Diagnostic — the sales tool
   488	
   489	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 4–5)
   490	- **Always-on?** No — invoked on demand
   491	- **Trigger type:** Manual (run from CLI or sales-tool web page)
   492	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None — runs as a one-shot batch job
   493	- **MCP tools required:** Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages
   494	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (uses Maddox's voice for the audit narrative), decision log writer
   495	- **External APIs:** Companies House API (free), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), basic HTTP fetch
   496	- **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data *(see `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` — per-section citation subcheck is hard-fail at v0; per-claim quality signal is a separate post-launch metric outside Gate A; voice classifier + PII subchecks remain per current `validate.sh`)*
   497	- **Gate B target:** ≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked
   498	- **Build complexity:** **M** (1 week)
   499	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn ToS — we cannot store profile data beyond the audit. Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.
   500	
   501	#### A2. The Janitor — the wedge agent
   502	
   503	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 5–6)
   504	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — scheduled nightly cron
   505	- **Trigger type:** Cron 02:00 UTC daily; manual full-cleanup on demand
   506	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None (scheduled batch)
   507	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read-write), Companies House (for entity enrichment)
   508	- **Shared modules required:** Decision log writer, escalation router
   509	- **External APIs:** Bullhorn REST API, Companies House
   510	- **Gate A:** dedup confidence score ≥ 0.85 on every merge proposal; no merge proposed where candidate has had activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag
   511	- **Gate B target:** day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement
   512	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the Bullhorn MCP work is the rate-limiting piece
   513	- **Gotchas:** Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0. Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself. Dedup is hard; start conservative (high-confidence merges only) and tune up.
   514	
   515	#### A3. The Scribe — the data spine
   516	
   517	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 6–7)
   518	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — webhook-driven

    25	  - System agent names (e.g., `_renderer` per ADR-003 + Day-5 schema migration) are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only. This schema covers tenant-domain entities; system-internal agents are out of scope.
    26	  - cortextOS substrate entities (PM2 process records, file-bus messages, approval gate entries) are NOT modelled here. They live in cortextOS's own state per master brief §2.4.
    27	  - Vault-internal artefacts (markdown pages, frontmatter, wiki-links) are NOT entity_types. The vault is the source of truth for narrative content; this schema is the source of truth for structured state. See master brief §3.3 vault/Postgres split.

     2	
     3	**Status:** Reference — single source of truth for `ESC_*` codes used by any agent. Wired into `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (Phase 3).
     4	**Mandated by:** master brief §8.1 Change 3 — "Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one."
     5	**Update protocol:** new codes added here BEFORE wiring into helpers + before referencing from any agent bundle. Code names are case-sensitive; pattern `ESC_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`.

     8	
     9	## §1 — How escalation codes work
    10	
    11	Every `ESC_*` is a payload written to Postgres `decision_log` (per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + Day-4 §6.3 schema) plus a Telegram notification to the operator (per master brief §2.4 primitive 5 + `common-notifications.json` routing).
    12	
    13	The payload template established by `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4 + ratified in `autosend-safety-policy.md` §5:
    14	
    15	```
    16	agent_name        — the agent firing the escalation (or '_renderer')
    17	tenant_slug       — RLS-isolated per tenant
    18	phase             — one of {trigger, output, action, gating_failed, agent_handoff}; per decision_log CHECK constraint at Day-4 §6.3
    19	human_action      — the ESC_* code itself + optional `:reason` suffix
    20	payload           — JSON object: {tier?, action_type?, target?, payload_hash?, reason, ...code-specific fields}
    21	created_at        — `now()` at insertion
    22	```
    23	
    24	The Telegram message is templated via `common-notifications.json` `escalation_routes.<ESC_CODE>` if present; otherwise routed to `operator_chat_id`. `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED` additionally CCs `ifos_oncall_chat_id`.

    48	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`
    49	- **Severity:** **critical** — operational failure, not a policy decision
    50	- **Trigger:** `autosend_policy_lookup()` could not resolve a tier for the given `action_type` (unknown action_type, malformed `autosend-policy.yaml`, or tenant override resolution failed)
    51	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    52	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` — IFOS oncall must investigate

    65	
    66	#### `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`
    67	- **Severity:** warn

   180	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   181	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   182	- **Payload fields:** `input_field`, `input_value_preview` (truncated to 80 chars), `validation_rule_violated`
   183	
   184	#### `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`
   185	- **Severity:** warn
   186	- **Trigger:** Agent produced output that doesn't match its declared output shape (e.g. Diagnostic report with section count != 12, missing per-section citation, validate.sh V1/V2 check fail). Distinct from `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` which is for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time

     1	# v1.0 kill criterion
     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed — pending Codex Day-7 ratification
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-18 (Week 0, Day 5)
     5	**Author:** Claude Code, with founder review pending
     6	**Master brief §:** §6 Day 5 (line 486) + §12 Risk Register + §1 Rule 5 (honest signal before optimistic projection)
     7	**Surfaced by:** Master brief Day 5 spec; folds carry-forwards from `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 + `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + Day-4 §11 closing-commit work.
     8	**Path drift logged:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 specifies `docs/v1-kill-criterion.md` (docs/ root). This artefact lives at `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` per repo convention. Recorded as **Edit 10** in atomic-correction manifest (shared with autosend-safety-policy.md path drift).

    12	## §1 — Definitions
    13	
    14	Three distinct end-states for v1.0:
    15	
    16	### KILL
    17	
    18	**Cease v1.0 development.** The wedge is invalidated by structural evidence. Existing pilots receive 30-day wind-down notice; assets liquidated or open-sourced; refund obligations honoured per pilot agreement. Founder pivots to next initiative.
    19	
    20	**KILL is reversible only as v1.1 or v2.0**: a wholly new initiative under different premises, with its own kill criterion. v1.0 itself does not resurrect.
    21	
    22	### PAUSE
    23	
    24	**Freeze v1.0 development for N weeks while data is gathered.** Existing pilots continue in read-only mode (agents that have shipped stay operational; no new agents ship). Founder + Jack conduct strategic review and define an unfreeze criterion.
    25	
    26	**PAUSE has a defined exit:** either unfreeze (resume v1.0 from the slice that was active when paused) OR escalate to KILL/PIVOT if the strategic review concludes the trigger is structural rather than temporary.
    27	
    28	### PIVOT
    29	
    30	**Rescope v1.0.** The wedge holds but its assumed shape is wrong. Common pivots:
    31	
    32	- **Vertical pivot:** recruitment → accountancy, insurance, or another UK SME services domain
    33	- **ATS pivot:** Bullhorn-first → Vincere-first, Voyager Infinity-first, or vertical-without-ATS
    34	- **Deployment pivot:** SaaS → self-hosted, or vice-versa
    35	- **Customer pivot:** consultant-facing → operations-team-facing → owner-facing
    36	
    37	**v1.0 commitments to existing pilots are honoured under original scope.** New v1.0 contracts under rescoped terms. The master brief and Ultraplan are amended by atomic-correction commit; Codex ratifies before v1.0 resumption.
    38	
    39	---
    40	
    41	## §2 — Binary triggers
    42	
    43	Each trigger has: measurable threshold, owner (detects), action (kill/pause/pivot), source justification.
    44	
    45	### Trigger 1 — DESIGN-PARTNER-BY-WEEK-2 (PAUSE)
    46	
    47	**Threshold:** No design partner has confirmed pilot intent (signed LOI or equivalent written commitment to pilot in Q3 2026 per master brief §6 Day 7 question 1) by end of Week 2.
    48	
    49	**Calendar:** Day 0 was 2026-05-13 (Wednesday). Week 0 runs Days 0-7, ending Wednesday 2026-05-20. Week 1 starts Thursday 2026-05-21. Week 2 ends Wednesday 2026-06-03. **Trigger fires end-of-day 2026-06-03 if criterion unmet.**
    50	
    51	**Owner:** Founder; daily check during Weeks 1-2.
    52	
    53	**Source:** Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (escalating status); Day-5 Risk #3 update reflects "zero design partners in pipeline" as of this commit; master brief §6 Day 7 question 1.
    54	
    55	**Action:** PAUSE state activated immediately. Agent code halts at end of current week's slice (rather than mid-slice). Founder pivots to full-time design-partner acquisition. Claude Code work limited to design-partner-supporting artefacts (sales decks, demo agents, pricing models).
    56	
    57	**Unfreeze criterion:** **One signed pilot LOI** from a UK recruitment agency with stated pilot start date in Q3 2026. Unfreeze formal: Founder + Jack joint sign-off on the LOI; resume v1.0 from the slice that was active when paused.
    58	
    59	**Escalation path if PAUSE extends:** if unfreeze not achieved within 4 weeks of PAUSE activation, strategic review reconvenes. Outcomes: (a) continue PAUSE if pipeline is materially active; (b) escalate to KILL if no pipeline activity; (c) escalate to PIVOT if pipeline rejection signals point to a different vertical/ATS.
    60	
    61	### Trigger 2 — DIAGNOSTIC-NO-RENDER-W3 (KILL)
    62	
    63	**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
    64	
    65	**Owner:** Claude Code (technical detection); founder review (decision authority). Weekly check during Weeks 1-3.
    66	
    67	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (i); Risk #5 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; ADR-003 §"Consequences" line 141 (renderer is load-bearing Week-1 deliverable).
    68	
    69	**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
    70	
    71	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons logged to `.agents/learnings/v1.0-postmortem.md`. v1.1 may begin as new initiative with reconsidered renderer architecture (or no per-tenant render, or different bundle pattern).
    72	
    73	### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
    74	
    75	**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
    76	
    77	**Owner:** Founder + Claude Code. Weekly check during Weeks 3-5.
    78	
    79	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (ii); Risk #2 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Sub-decisions A + B (currently Proposed pending Sunday/Monday commercial conversations — which themselves have not happened due to design-partner-pipeline gap).
    80	
    81	**Action:** PIVOT state. Rescope from Bullhorn-first to alternate ATS-first:
    82	
    83	- **Option A:** Vincere-first. Mid-market UK recruitment ATS; smaller market than Bullhorn but more accessible API.
    84	- **Option B:** Voyager Infinity-first. UK-native ATS; smaller market; alternative auth model.
    85	- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
    86	
    87	Rescope plan attached to PIVOT decision; existing pilots receive 14-day notice with rescope explanation.
    88	
    89	**Recovery path:** PIVOT is structural; resumption is via rescoped v1.0 under new ATS assumption. Pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted master brief / Ultraplan; atomic-correction commit lands the rescope.
    90	
    91	### Trigger 4 — TWO-SCOPE-CUT-ACTIVATIONS (PAUSE)
    92	
    93	**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
    94	
    95	**Owner:** Founder; logged in `.agents/decisions/` when activated.
    96	
    97	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (iii); master brief §12 Risk #4 (Hire #1 mitigation calls for scope cut from 6 → 4 agents but explicitly warns against further cuts).
    98	
    99	**Action:** PAUSE state. Rationale: two scope cuts indicates either (a) the v1.0 wedge is structurally too narrow to be valuable, or (b) build velocity is fundamentally below the rate v1.0 requires. Either way, continuing to ship more agents is the wrong move; strategic review needed.
   100	
   101	**Unfreeze criterion:** Strategic review by Founder + Jack within 2 weeks of PAUSE activation produces one of three outcomes:
   102	
   103	1. **Unfreeze with scope:** restored to 4 agents (no further cuts); resume with adjusted timeline.
   104	2. **Escalate to PIVOT:** rescope vertical or customer-type; pivoted v1.0 has new agent fleet definition.
   105	3. **Escalate to KILL:** the wedge as designed cannot ship even at reduced scope.
   106	
   107	### Trigger 5 — AUTOSEND-RED-MISCATEGORISATIONS (PAUSE)
   108	
   109	**Threshold:** More than 3 confirmed red-tier autosend breaches per pilot per week from actions that should have been classified as green or yellow. "Confirmed" means: tenant operator files a `false-block` feedback report via Brain UI (or equivalent v1.0 manual channel) AND IFOS oncall agrees the tier classification was wrong. Threshold measured per individual pilot over rolling 7-day windows.
   110	
   111	**Owner:** IFOS oncall + tenant operator. Daily check via `decision_log` queries: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_log WHERE phase='gating_failed' AND payload->>'tier'='red' AND payload->>'block_reason'='red_tier_classification' AND tenant_slug=? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
   112	
   113	**Source:** `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 + §10; Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (LUKS manual unlock has higher impact but autosend miscategorisation has higher frequency).
   114	
   115	**Action:** PAUSE for the affected pilot. The agent that produced the miscategorisations halts at next session boundary. Founder + Jack review the policy tier classifications within 48 hours. Policy revision (via Codex ratification) lands as a new commit; affected pilot receives incident report. Pilot resumes after policy revision.
   116	
   117	**Escalation path:** If three pilots experience this trigger within one quarter, escalate to system-wide PAUSE while structural autosend policy redesign happens (potential v1.1 advancement of orange tier).
   118	
   119	### Trigger 6 — UNIT-ECONOMICS-COST-PER-ACTION (PIVOT)
   120	
   121	**Threshold:** Cost-per-completed-action (defined as: total IFOS infrastructure + API + Claude inference cost ÷ count of `decision_log` rows with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier IN ('green','yellow','orange-approved')`) exceeds **£0.50 per action** after 4 tenant-weeks of operation.
   122	
   123	**Operational-guess threshold; pilot data overrides.** Tune after first 100 pilot actions provide real cost-per-action data. Pre-pilot rationale: £0.50/action × ~200 actions/tenant-month = £100/tenant-month gross cost; viable only above £500/tenant-month revenue. If first-pilot data shows on-target spend, tighten threshold to ~£0.10/action (current £0.005 estimate × 20x safety margin).
   124	
   125	The £0.50 figure assumes:
   126	
   127	- Claude Sonnet 4.6 inference at ~£0.003 per action (small prompt, output cached)
   128	- Bullhorn API call at <£0.001 per action (free tier)
   129	- Hetzner infrastructure at ~£8/mo / ~10k actions/mo ≈ £0.0008 per action
   130	- Total: ~£0.005 per action would be on-track; £0.50 is 100x over-target
   131	
   132	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check.
   133	
   134	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 pilot scale; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); emerging from v1.0 pilot operations.
   135	
   136	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.
   137	
   138	**Recovery path:** Rescoped pricing/architecture; pivoted v1.0 continues.
   139	
   140	### Trigger 7 — INFRASTRUCTURE-COST-MONTHLY (PIVOT)
   141	
   142	**Threshold:** Total Hetzner monthly infrastructure cost exceeds **£100/month at 3 active tenants**.
   143	
   144	**Rationale:** 15x headroom from the current £6.40/month single-tenant baseline (per Day-4 runbook §1.4: CX22 + 50 GB volume + backups = €5 + €1.20 + €2.40 ≈ £6.40). At 3 tenants on shared single-server architecture, expected cost should remain near baseline. If Postgres + LUKS-volume growth + vector-index growth pushes >£100/month at 3 tenants, infrastructure approach needs pivot.
   145	
   146	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check via Hetzner billing.
   147	
   148	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 single-tenant pilot; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); Risk #4 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (Hire #1 delays compound infrastructure spend if architecture sprawls).
   149	
   150	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vectors:
   151	
   152	- **Self-host:** founder's Mac Studio cluster from prior research as primary; Hetzner as backup. Saves money but adds maintenance.
   153	- **Provider switch:** alternate eu-central provider (Mythic Beasts, OVH, Scaleway) with better price-per-tenant economics.
   154	- **Architecture compaction:** per-tenant resource pooling rather than per-tenant servers.
   155	
   156	**Recovery path:** Rescoped infrastructure plan; pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (master brief does not specify a numeric cost target; budget adjustment is a runbook revision, not a master-brief edit).
   157	
   158	### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
   159	
   160	**Threshold:** After 3 completed pilots (defined as: pilot ran for ≥90 days with active agent fleet and quarterly Gate B revenue measurement), average Gate B revenue uplift per tenant <£20k/year.
   161	
   162	**Owner:** Founder; assessed at end of each pilot.
   163	
   164	**Source:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 — canonical example trigger from master brief.
   165	
   166	**Action:** KILL. Rationale: the wedge does not produce demonstrable ROI at the threshold required to sustain v1.0 commercially. £20k/year/tenant is the breakeven floor — below this, IFOS cannot fund continued operation at v1.0 pricing.
   167	
   168	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons feed v1.1 if launched. The vertical assumption (UK recruitment) or product assumption (agent fleet vs. point tools) may need reconsidering for any next initiative.
   169	
   170	### Trigger 9 — CORTEXOS-PRIMITIVE-CHRONIC-FAILURE (PAUSE)
   171	
   172	**Threshold:** cortextOS primitives 3 (file bus per `cortexos-primitive-status.md` line item 3) or 4 (approval gates per primitive 4) report >1 production incident per week across **2 consecutive weeks** for any single pilot.
   173	
   174	**Threshold tightened Day 5 (2026-05-18) from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.** Rationale: Risk #1 severity was downgraded Day 1 because primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" per `cortexos-primitive-status.md`. If field evidence shows failure-rate spike for 2 consecutive weeks, that is an actionable signal — waiting 4 weeks delays remediation by 50% within the v1.0 build timeline (Weeks 1-13).
   175	
   176	**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
   177	
   178	**Source:** Master brief §12 Risk #1; Day-1 audit results in `cortexos-primitive-status.md` (primitive 1 PTY/PM2 is "shipped but flaky"; primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" but field evidence may diverge).
   179	
   180	**Action:** PAUSE. Rationale: cortextOS primitive instability is a structural threat to every IFOS agent — every agent uses the file bus and most use approval gates. Chronic failure points to either (a) cortextOS regression upstream OR (b) IFOS usage pattern incompatible with cortextOS at scale.
   181	
   182	**Unfreeze criterion:** Either (1) cortextOS upstream PR lands the fix (per master brief §3.1 cross-vertical primitive process), OR (2) IFOS vendor-patches via `packages/harness-patches/` per master brief §3.1 fallback path. Unfreeze after **2 consecutive incident-free weeks** (matched to tightened threshold).
   183	
   184	**Escalation path:** Persistent failure after both PR and patch attempts triggers structural review — potential PIVOT to alternative runtime (different harness).
   185	
   186	### Trigger 10 — PII-LEAKAGE-INCIDENT (KILL)
   187	
   188	**Threshold:** ANY confirmed incident in which agent action results in PII (personally-identifiable information per UK GDPR Art. 4(1)) transmitted to an unauthorised party (cross-tenant recipient, unauthorised external recipient, or recipient outside tenant's declared data residency) AND not blocked by the RLS + autosend policy combination.
   189	
   190	**"Confirmed" means:** the incident is documented in `.agents/incidents/<date>-pii-leakage-<n>.md` with: recipient identity, data classes transmitted, attack vector (or accidental cause), and reproduction steps. False alarms (e.g., recipient was authorised but operator was unaware) do not trigger.

codex
I found at least one load-bearing mismatch: the document cites helper functions and escalation-code semantics that need to match the shared contracts exactly. I’m doing one more pass for source-line evidence so the verdict can stay terse and concrete.

   336	- **Payload fields:** `channel` (`gmail` | `outlook` | `twilio` | `telegram`), `recipient_id_hash`, `error_class`, `attempts_made`
   337	
   338	### 2.9 — Auto-send orchestration (4 codes)
   339	Source: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 extensions; runtime orchestration semantics
   340	
   341	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING`
   342	- **Severity:** info — distinct from ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW (which is the initial queue event)
   343	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action has been pending operator response for ≥50% of declared `timeout` (heartbeat reminder before bridge timeout)
   344	- **Phase:** `action`
   345	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` (gentle reminder; no oncall)
   346	- **Payload fields:** `original_decision_log_id`, `action_type`, `time_pending_seconds`, `timeout_seconds`, `time_remaining_seconds`
   347	
   348	#### `ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT`
   349	- **Severity:** warn — orange action's approval window expired without response
   350	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action exceeded its `timeout` (default PT4H) without operator approve/reject
   351	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   352	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` (operator absent + commitment may need rerouting)
   353	- **Payload fields:** `original_decision_log_id`, `action_type`, `timeout_seconds`, `target`, `payload_preview`
   354	- **Recovery:** action converts to manual reconciliation; operator handles offline
   355	
   356	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE`
   357	- **Severity:** warn — concurrency / state-change race
   358	- **Trigger:** A send is about to fire when the underlying state has changed in a way that should suppress it. Two canonical use cases:
   359	  - **Duplicate-payload race:** two agents attempted to send the same `payload_hash` within same tenant within `race_window_seconds` (default 60s); second attempt detected by `decision_log` UPSERT-conflict; second wins-suppressed (first sends; idempotency by payload_hash)
   360	  - **State-change race (Cash Conductor):** payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window; the invoice is no longer overdue when the orange-tier approval fires; chase cancelled (do NOT send) per Cash Conductor §4 Step 12
   361	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   362	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   363	- **Payload fields:** `race_class` (`duplicate_payload` | `state_change_cancellation`), `payload_hash`, class-specific: duplicate → `first_agent_name`, `second_agent_name`, `time_delta_ms`, `action_type`; state-change → `entity_id`, `state_before`, `state_after`, `time_delta_ms`
   364	- **Recovery:** duplicate → second suppressed; state-change → cancelled draft logged; no operator action required beyond informational review
   365	
   366	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK`
   367	- **Severity:** info — quality sampling, not a failure
   368	- **Trigger:** Yellow-tier action was sampled per `sample_rate` (1-in-N) for post-hoc human review; sampling is informational + drives ongoing quality monitoring
   369	- **Phase:** `action`
   370	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; sampled action is queued in `spot_check_queue_path` (`/vault/{tenant_slug}/spot-checks/`)
   371	- **Payload fields:** `action_type`, `original_decision_log_id`, `sample_rate`, `sampling_reason`, `target`, `payload_preview`
   372	- **Note:** Operator review of sampled rows is asynchronous (typically end-of-day batch); no SLA timer.
   373	
   374	### 2.10 — Agent workflow (10 codes)
   375	Source: v1.0 agent.md draft specs across Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Cash Conductor, Concierge
   376	
   377	#### `ESC_GATE_B_MISS`
   378	- **Severity:** warn — post-send quality signal; not a hard failure
   379	- **Trigger:** Agent's local Gate B metric thresholds missed for the per-agent window (e.g. Janitor dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%; Diagnostic <30% discovery-call conversion rate; etc — see each agent.md §5)
   380	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   381	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   382	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `metric_name`, `actual_value`, `threshold`, `window`, `sample_size`
   383	- **Note:** Local Gate B is a leading metric for agent quality; consecutive misses inform per-agent quality review. Not tied to a kill-criterion trigger in v1.0 (per disagreement-doc Cat-3 disposition).
   384	
   385	#### `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION`
   386	- **Severity:** warn — voice/tone classifier flagged output as violating a tenant `tone_rule` row
   387	- **Trigger:** Output drafted by an agent matches a tenant-defined `tone_rule` violation pattern (e.g. tenant prohibits "absolutely" in customer-facing comms; output contained it)
   388	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   389	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   390	- **Payload fields:** `tone_rule_id`, `pattern_violated`, `output_snippet_redacted`, `agent_name`, `tenant_slug`
   391	- **Recovery:** agent re-drafts with violation removed; if persistent, escalates to tone_rule review
   392	
   393	#### `ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE`
   394	- **Severity:** warn
   395	- **Trigger:** Field extraction (Janitor backfill / Scribe call-summary / Sourcing CV-parse) returned confidence below per-field threshold (default 0.7); writing the field would risk bad data

    41	  v0.4 scope is INTENTIONALLY NARROW: 5 new tenant_adapters.config keys, no
    42	  entity field changes, no auxiliary tables, no agent access matrix changes,
    43	  no decision_log payload changes. This keeps the supplement reviewable and
    44	  the migration short.
    45	
    46	  Founder confirmed 2026-06-03: IFOS Granola workspace will be on
    47	  Business+/Paid tier (Business OR Enterprise). The two Paid-only Granola
    48	  MCP tools (list_meeting_folders, get_meeting_transcript per @ifos/granola
    49	  v0.1.0 PAID_PLAN_TOOLS) are therefore unlocked-by-default at provisioning.
    50	  Tenant onboarding pre-caches plan_tier='paid' in the GranolaClient via
    51	  getAccountInfo() so the per-call Paid-plan guard short-circuits before any
    52	  wire round-trip. There is no granola_plan_tier config key — the tier is
    53	  resolved at runtime via the Granola API rather than mirrored into IFOS
    54	  state (avoids drift when the founder changes plans).
    55	
    56	  Plan-doc fix-forward landed alongside this supplement: the W5 plan doc
    57	  originally listed workos_directory_id as the 5th key, intended for SCIM
    58	  provisioning support. SCIM write-back is v1.1+ scope per master brief §6;
    59	  the Day-29 vendor pivot from Fathom/Fireflies to Granola made
    60	  granola_workspace_id the higher-priority addition (W6 Scribe needs the
    61	  per-tenant Granola workspace identifier; v1.1+ supplement can add
    62	  workos_directory_id when SCIM lands).
    63	
    64	# ============================================================================
    65	# §1 — tenant_adapters.config additions (5 new top-level keys)
    66	# ============================================================================
    67	#
    68	# Each key is hard-fail-on-unknown via the validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_4

    81	      Per-tenant Telegram chat ID for the operator who approves orange-tier
    82	      autosends per D1-B (docs/decisions/2026-05-31-d1-founder-decision.md).
    83	      Consumed by @ifos/autosend-bridge-telegram via the consumer's
    84	      context.sh: SELECT config->>'operator_telegram_chat_id' FROM
    85	      tenant_adapters WHERE tenant_slug=$1.
    86	
    87	      Path A (reuse approval_routing.default_recipient) and Path B (this
    88	      top-level key) are BOTH schema-clean post-v0.4. The recommended
    89	      production path is Path A for new tenants (one JSONB sub-tree per
    90	      autosend-relevant config, cleaner upgrade story to v1.1+ rich-panel
    91	      approvals); Path B exists for tenants who want a simpler single-key
    92	      override + clarity in the wizard. Until a tenant explicitly sets
    93	      either, the env-var fallback IFOS_FORCE_OPERATOR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
    94	      remains supported for local dev / fixtures.
    95	
    96	      Telegram chat IDs are integers but presented as strings here to avoid
    97	      JSON number-precision issues across the consumer stack (Bash + jq +
    98	      Postgres JSONB). Pattern accepts both positive (user chat) and
    99	      negative (group chat) IDs.

   109	      Per-tenant outbound email provider selection. Concierge cycle.sh
   110	      Step 3 reads to route email_provider OAuth refresh + send calls.
   111	      Default 'microsoft-graph' matches the UK recruitment-agency norm
   112	      per W3 vendor survey; tenants with a Workspace-only IT estate select
   113	      'gmail' at onboarding wizard.
   114	
   115	      Currently consumed via IFOS_FORCE_EMAIL_CHANNEL env-var fallback in
   116	      concierge/context.sh line 92; v0.4 enables the canonical
   117	      tenant_adapters read path. The TODO(W10-13) marker in context.sh
   118	      flips from "supplement-pending" to "supplement-landed; canonical
   119	      source is the SELECT, env-var fallback remains for fixtures".
   120	
   121	      v1.1+ scope: add 'gsuite-modern' + 'exchange-on-prem' as the on-prem
   122	      tenants surface. v1.0 supports only the two cloud-OAuth providers.

   131	      Per-tenant WorkOS organisation identifier. Consumed by @ifos/workos
   132	      (Day-29 Phase 2 scaffold; commit 6dc5a4a) for organization-scoped
   133	      reads (getOrganization, listConnections.organization_id filter,
   134	      listDirectories.organization_id filter, etc.).
   135	
   136	      Per master brief §5.3 line 401 WorkOS AuthKit is the v1.0 IFOS auth
   137	      substrate; the per-tenant org_id is set at tenant provisioning when
   138	      the founder runs `bash scripts/run-tenant-provisioning.sh <tenant>`
   139	      (W6+ runbook; not yet authored).
   140	
   141	      v1.0 agent consumers: none directly (admin/onboarding UI is the
   142	      primary consumer). v1.1+ adds the SSO-aware admin agent that wires
   143	      tenant onboarding through getOrganization. The allowlist entry lands
   144	      now to unblock that v1.1+ agent without a second schema supplement.

   152	      Per-tenant Granola workspace identifier. Consumed by @ifos/granola
   153	      (Day-29 Phase 3 scaffold; commit 1b657e6) — every GranolaClient is
   154	      constructed with config.workspace_id which sets the rate-limit
   155	      bucket + token persistence namespace + cache namespace.
   156	
   157	      Bootstrap dance (per Granola browser OAuth + DCR; @ifos/granola
   158	      README §Authentication): founder runs the one-time consent dance
   159	      per workspace; IFOS captures the resulting access_token +
   160	      refresh_token + the workspace_id from get_account_info; persists

    95	|---|---|---|
    96	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
    97	| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
    98	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
    99	| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Internal sales tool per Product Spec §2.2 R13 ("Not on the customer pricing card"). Drives qualified discovery-call pipeline. Demoable to a prospect but not the closing demo. Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target: "≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked" |
   100	| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **None** | Standalone. No upstream agent dependency; no downstream agent consumes Diagnostic output |
   101	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **High** | Runnable from end of Week 2 with renderer + `_shared/` + Postgres decision_log. No vault `_secrets.env` complexity (no per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth needed), no wiki API needed. Single-tenant deployable immediately |
   102	
   103	**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.

   105	### 2.2 — A2 Janitor
   106	
   107	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
   108	|---|---|---|
   109	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 513 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — the Bullhorn MCP work is rate-limiting per Ultraplan §8.1 line 514 ("Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build"). One MCP server (Bullhorn) + Companies House for enrichment. Single primary output (cleanup report) but with continuous nightly cron pattern |
   110	| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
   111	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
   112	| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
   113	| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
   114	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
   115	
   116	**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
   117	
   118	### 2.3 — A3 Scribe
   119	
   120	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
   121	|---|---|---|
   122	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 526 estimate **M (1 week)**. Webhook-driven not always-on. Structured-field mapping is per-firm config not code per Ultraplan §8.1 line 526. Tacit-note extraction is the hard part per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 ("Start with a small taxonomy (5-10 tacit-note types) and expand") |
   123	| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
   124	| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
   125	| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 603: "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable." Product Spec §2.2 R6: "Your firm's institutional memory finally lives somewhere." Critical downstream: **every Tier-1 v1.0 agent reuses Scribe's voice-and-tacit-note plumbing** |

docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:62:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS. Every tenant runs the same agent fleet (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge in v1.0) against their own data, isolated from every other tenant's data. **A single cross-tenant data leak is a catastrophic failure mode** — it breaches the GDPR contract, violates pilot LOI terms, and burns customer trust. There is no "minor" cross-tenant leak.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:5:**Purpose:** Drop-in email drafts the founder sends to Bullhorn partnerships + developer support to resolve Sub-decisions A + B in `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`. Closes Risk #2 mitigation path; unblocks Janitor W5 build gate.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:17:**These don't block today.** They block **Janitor W5 build** (per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3). You have ~5 weeks of runway.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:944:- **Week 13:** wiki-aware agent integration — Concierge (v1.0 A6, master brief §8.2) is the first user; voice-loader.sh from §2.4.3 reads `voice_samples_embedded` via the new library; first end-to-end Concierge run hits the wiki for `search-by-name` and `update-entity`. Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view from master brief §6 Day 3) is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed.

docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:150:- **Agent outputs in design partner's existing tools** — Bullhorn notes (Janitor + Scribe writes), Outlook / Gmail emails (Concierge auto-send drafts), Telegram approval messages (per cortextOS Primitive 5).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:75:Six v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge. Each action below has a v1.0 default tier; tenant overrides can elevate (see §8).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:82:| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_tag` | Adds a tag with `checked_at` date; reversible in <30s; high volume |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:92:| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` | 1-in-10 | Merges duplicate candidate records; reversible but high-volume; merge quality needs ongoing review |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:111:| Janitor | `bullhorn_placement_terminate` | Marks placement as terminated; commercial/legal implications; reversible only via support ticket |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:636:**For Week 5-13 (Janitor → Concierge).** Each agent's `tools.yaml` declares its action_types. The renderer per ADR-003 §4 validates declarations against this policy. Bullhorn-integration-path §4.1 + §6.3's Concierge Note auto-send sensitivity ("notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI") is materially mitigated: the canonical orange example in §3 ensures every Concierge Note write goes through approval at v1.0 (ad-hoc) and v1.1+ (policy-driven).
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:20:| 5 | Janitor (Bullhorn R+W) |

docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:43:| W5 Day 28+: Janitor build start | W5 Day 28+: **Conditional on Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted** |
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:50:4. **De-risks the Q1 pitch.** Master brief §8.2 line 595 explicitly names Diagnostic as the "sales tool." Jack's Q1 pitch goes from abstract ("AI for recruitment") to concrete ("here's a Diagnostic for your firm") once we have one real artefact.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:52:6. **Documented contingency.** This is the milder version of ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 row contingency: *"defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1."* We're deferring only the Bullhorn-touching agents pending Bullhorn answer; Diagnostic stays on track.
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:63:### Week 5 (Day 28+) — Janitor build conditional gating
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:65:| Bullhorn A+B state by Day 28 | Janitor action |

docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:68:| Either still Proposed | Janitor build deferred 1 week; Diagnostic polish + LinkedIn (Proxycurl) signed-up + W6 work pulled forward |
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:69:| Bullhorn unresponsive past 2026-06-10 | Force Direct-API fallback per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.4; Janitor scaffold begins; Bullhorn auth gated on first pilot raising support ticket |
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:73:- Scribe (W6) depends on Bullhorn write; same gating as Janitor
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:74:- Cash Conductor (W7-8) does NOT touch Bullhorn (per master brief §8.2 line 597); proceeds independent of A+B

Concierge `context.sh` TODO(W10-13) markers updated 2026-06-03 (commit `98ab8ce`) to reflect supplement-landed state. Codex ratification currently in flight under cluster G (R3 closing 2026-06-02 per `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-06-02-*` ledger and the cluster G round-trip arc); v0.4 supplement will ratify separately under W5 Phase 7 F-tris cluster.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §8.2 (the build-order table) + Ultraplan §9 (the existing 14-week sprint plan) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + §6 for the Bullhorn-dependency carry-forward; then `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` §5.2 for the renderer's Week-1-prerequisite role.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:17:Master brief §8.2 (lines 597-611) names six v1.0 agents and assigns build weeks:
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:19:| # | Agent | Weeks (master brief §8.2) | Key dependency | Why this order (master brief verbatim) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:22:| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:34:- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:44:**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:90:Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:98:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:105:### 2.2 — A2 Janitor
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:111:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER).

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:112:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:114:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:125:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 603: "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable." Product Spec §2.2 R6: "Your firm's institutional memory finally lives somewhere." Critical downstream: **every Tier-1 v1.0 agent reuses Scribe's voice-and-tacit-note plumbing** |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:126:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:127:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:129:**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:136:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First Tier-1 always-on agent** — exercises cortextOS **Primitive 1** (persistent PTY/PM2, flagged "shipped but flaky" in cortextos-primitive-status.md). First exercise of **Primitive 4** (approval gates) for chase email auto-send per master brief §8.2 line 604. First exercise of **Primitive 5** (Telegram approval surface) for FD-tier approval flow. **Does NOT touch Bullhorn** — independent integration path per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.2 (Cash Conductor uses Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking, not Bullhorn) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:138:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 604: "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'." Product Spec §2.2 R2: £40-120k working capital unlock per agency, "one bad debt caught per quarter pays for the entire suite" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library. Source-abstraction layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 designed to be reusable by Night Sourcer v1.1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:155:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn (already on if Janitor shipped) + LinkedIn (Proxycurl API key — single application-level key, not per-tenant) + Reed OAuth + CV-Library OAuth per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:166:| 4. Commercial value | **Highest** | Per master brief §8.2 line 606: "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build." Product Spec §2.2 R7: 15-25% lift in placement-driven referral revenue ("post-placement nurture is the cheapest BD channel in recruitment and you currently leave it on the table"). The flagship v1.0 closing demo |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:176:Three orderings evaluated against §1.3 criteria. **Option Alpha is the master-brief §8.2 canonical sequence** (correcting the §1.5 founder-prompt drift); Options Beta and Gamma are tested as alternatives.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:178:### 3.1 — Option Alpha (canonical, master-brief §8.2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:182:W5:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:208:W5-8: Concierge (A6) — front-load the flagship (XL/4 weeks)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:209:W9:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:304:- **Updates required:** `.agents/current-priorities.md` open list; this document's §4.1 table; master brief §8.2 (atomic correction commit edit, joining the 7-edit manifest); `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risk #2 row.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:318:- **Updates required:** §4.1 table (Cash Conductor weeks); master brief §8.2; downstream agent weeks shift accordingly.

The earlier draft concern about W3 vs W4 is resolved by the build-window-vs-completion-week distinction: Diagnostic build window is W3-W4; first production render lands W4.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:408:First exercise is Janitor at W5 per §4.1 row 2. **If Day 2 Sub-decisions A and B haven't flipped from Proposed to Accepted by start of W4** (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 commercial-blocker table), this is the natural blocker. Founder Sunday/Monday commercial conversations must land before W4 start to keep the Janitor W5 slot intact. Sub-decision C is already Accepted so the endpoint surface is buildable; the gate is auth path (A) and client_credentials foreclosure (B).

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:73:### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:75:**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:85:- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:334:- The agent fleet of 6 named in master brief §8.2 (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:375:**For Week 3-13 (v1.0 build).** Every agent build references this kill criterion. Diagnostic (W3-4) faces Trigger 2; Janitor (W5) faces Trigger 3; all agents from W3 onward face Triggers 5, 6, 9. The kill criterion is the operational definition of "are we still on-track" at each weekly review.
docs/features/agent-build/01-LAUNCH.md:24:- Bullhorn dev creds are BLOCKED: Janitor/Scribe/Concierge build to gate-green + fixture-proven; live-Bullhorn-smoke is a founder-gated post-creds step (per each spec §8). Do NOT block on it.
docs/features/agent-build/01-LAUNCH.md:30:2. FAN OUT parallel background worktrees: Janitor (spec-001) + Scribe (spec-002).

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:23:**Sub-decision C — v1.0 endpoint surface.** Which Bullhorn endpoints each of the v1.0 agents (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge — see §1.2) reads and writes, the cadence (real-time webhook vs scheduled poll vs ad-hoc request-response), and the rate-limit budget allocation. Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:40:**Four of six v1.0 agents directly touch Bullhorn.** The two that don't (Diagnostic, Cash Conductor) have independent paths. So Bullhorn integration timing gates ~67% of the v1.0 agent build.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:62:- **What ATS the first design partner uses.** If the first signed pilot is on Vincere or Voyager Infinity instead of Bullhorn, Sub-decision C's endpoint surface (and the Janitor / Concierge build order) needs revisiting per master brief §6 Day 2 Sub-decision and Ultraplan §9.1 sequencing.

The endpoint surface required by the four Bullhorn-touching v1.0 agents (Janitor R+W, Scribe W, Sourcing Scout R, Concierge R+W per §1.2) is fully addressable via documented direct-API REST endpoints — barring a commercially-gated discovery in §1.3 conversation that contradicts this.

docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:6:**Master plan citations:** Master brief §8.2 (build sequence; W6 = Scribe primary build week per line 597; W5+ Janitor + Scribe + Sourcing Scout transitions from SKELETON to LIVE) + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A3 (Scribe build complexity M = 1 week per line 526) + W5 close state in `docs/operations/decision-log.md` Day 34.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:7:**Strategic premise:** W5 left ALL 5 v1.0 agent bundles at SKELETON tier (TODO(W6+) markers throughout). W6 transitions from scaffold-vs-live mismatch to live wiring as external dependencies land. Order of operations is dependency-driven: each agent's live wiring waits on its dependent MCP package having LIVE creds.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:8:**Quality bar:** Same as W5 — each artefact production-quality; tests-clean before commit; honest-signal pattern preserved (don't claim "live integration verified" until it is).
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:10:**Builds on:** `docs/operations/goal-week-5-execution-plan.md` (W5 plan); W5 deliverables enumerated in `.agents/current-priorities.md` W5 CLOSED section + `decision-log.md` Day 34.

docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:24:7. **Per-MCP-package: `packages/mcp-connectors/<package>/README.md`** §"Live tests deferred" notes — these document what TODO(W5-live) or TODO(W6-live) markers W6 fills in
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:42:### B — Janitor secondary build (Days 38-39)
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:44:8. **Janitor `cycle.sh` Steps 1-9 wired live** — TODO(W6-7) markers replaced with real `@ifos/bullhorn` calls (refreshTokens, listCandidates with passive-match filter, updateCandidate for dedupe + field-backfill, createNote for tacit-note attach) + `@ifos/companies-house` enrichment lookups.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:45:9. **Janitor `validate.sh` Gate A G1-G7 wired live** — per-write proposal JSON parsing + per-check validation + per-failure ESC routing.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:46:10. **First real nightly cron run** against migration-test tenant — Janitor scans Bullhorn, identifies dedup candidates, writes merge actions (with operator approval gate for review-band per ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED), assembles day-30 report.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:50:W6 partial because Sourcing Scout's W9 build slice per master brief §8.2 line 599 — Day 40+ is preparation, not the full Sourcing Scout production wiring. Specifically:
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:59:15. All 5 v1.0 agent bundles in some live-wired state (full LIVE = Scribe + Janitor; PARTIAL = Sourcing Scout MCP packages ready, agent wait for W9).
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:72:- Bullhorn dev-support reply (if delayed past 2026-06-09) → may push Scribe/Janitor live tests into W7
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:82:**Re-scope note (2026-06-05):** Phase 1 originally bundled Bullhorn + Granola live tests. Split into 1a (Bullhorn; this section) + 1b (Granola; below) per Day 36 morning analysis when the new session surfaced two genuine blockers on the Granola side: (1) `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` binding still TODO(W5-live) — the `@ifos/granola` v0.1.0 package is `GranolaTransport`-interface-only; (2) founder's Granola workspace returns 0 meetings — needs ≥1 recorded meeting before `getMeeting`/`getTranscript` live tests have data to exercise. Bullhorn is unblocked + load-bearing for downstream Scribe/Janitor/Concierge live wiring; ships first.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:133:### Phase 5 — Day 38 (2026-06-07): Janitor live wiring (half-day each)
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:140:### Phase 6 — Day 39 (2026-06-08): Janitor end-to-end + first nightly cron

docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:200:None of these block the SKELETON layer — but ALL block the corresponding live wiring. If founder gates slip, the wiring phase slips with them; SKELETON state at W5 close is good enough to pause indefinitely without losing momentum.
docs/operations/goal-week-6-execution-plan.md:206:W5 close added the cluster F-tris manifest entry (per scripts/run-codex-ratification.sh). W6's natural agent.md ↔ code reconciliation (when both files are touched in same workflow per the disagreement-doc framework) will resolve some of the disagreement-on-file artefacts.

Allows: Day 1-2 = bridge code + tests; Day 3 = live integration test on migration-test tenant; Day 4 (Concierge W10 start) = Concierge uses bridge from day 1.

Granola live path is itself blocked: IFOS-side OAuth token not on disk (the Claude-Code MCP token is in keychain, not the `~/.ifos-local-vault/<tenant>/granola-tokens-*.json` path the connector reads) + the test workspace has 0 recorded meetings.

The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.

docs/operations/goal-option-c-diagnostic-end-to-end.md:251:- **Context:** ULTRAPLAN §8.1 specifies Week 3 = Bullhorn MCP, Week 4 = Diagnostic. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B remain Proposed pending Bullhorn partnership response (sent 2026-05-23). Diagnostic has zero Bullhorn dependency per master brief §8.2 line 595.
docs/operations/goal-option-c-diagnostic-end-to-end.md:253:- **Consequences:** Janitor W5 build conditional on Bullhorn A+B Accepted. If A+B answer arrives after 2026-06-03, Janitor slips to W6+; if no answer by 2026-06-10, force Direct-API fallback per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.4.

docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-003-sourcing-scout.md:8:- **Mirror template:** Cash Conductor (LLM render→vault + report assembler + RLS idiom) + reuse the **Janitor fuzzy matcher** (spec-001 §4 Step 3) for cross-source dedupe.
docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-003-sourcing-scout.md:30:| Step | What to implement | marker | ESC on fail | CC/Janitor pattern |

docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-003-sourcing-scout.md:61:- `scripts/run-scout-dedupe-test.sh` — seeded multi-source candidate sets → assert cross-source dedupe + provenance + the ≥0.85 matcher (reuse Janitor matcher fixtures).
docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-003-sourcing-scout.md:66:- **🟢 MOST LIVE-CAPABLE of the 4 agents.** CV-Library creds are SET → Step 6 + the full rank→report path can be **live-smoked end-to-end in degraded mode (CV-Library only)** producing a real ranked report. Strongly consider Sourcing Scout (not Janitor) as the live prove-one demo — it needs no Bullhorn write + has a live source.
docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-003-sourcing-scout.md:73:- Can run in parallel with: Janitor, Scribe (disjoint files). Reuses the Janitor matcher → spawn after Janitor lands that helper, or carry a copy + reconcile at review.
docs/features/agent-build/03-implementation/janitor-summary.md:1:# Janitor — W6-7 build-slice summary (spec-001, PROVE-ONE pilot)
docs/features/agent-build/03-implementation/janitor-summary.md:53:1. **Fuzzy-matcher scoring normalisation.** Spec-001 §4's literal weight-sum can never reach 0.85 for a name+email-only match (caps at 0.7). Implemented the Scout-reviewed semantics named in the build brief: matched-weight / comparable-weight normalisation + a required strong-identifier match (email|phone|linkedin), same weights, same 0.85 threshold. Band→action table kept exactly per spec §4. Cross-agent reconciliation with Scout's `bin/fuzzy-match.sh` queued for review (the two scripts share normalisation + scoring verbatim; Janitor's emits pairs/bands, Scout's emits clusters).
docs/features/agent-build/03-implementation/janitor-summary.md:66:- **🔴 Bullhorn creds remain EMPTY** (re-verified comment-aware names-only check 2026-06-10: all six `BULLHORN_*` keys EMPTY). Janitor is BUILT + fixture-proven + gate-green; the live Bullhorn smoke (refresh → scan → one sandbox write) is a founder-gated post-creds step. The CLI bridge + cycle.sh call-sites are the wired surface it runs through.
docs/features/agent-build/02-specs/spec-004-concierge.md:78:- Sequence after Janitor/Scribe/Sourcing-Scout prove the bundle pattern; the autosend-bridge wiring is the cross-cutting deliverable that also closes Cash Conductor's send loop.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:253:Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's assumption: **close the first three pilots fastest**. That means Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before Triage absorbs the development heat. Revise only if a hire's signed or a different pilot dynamic emerges.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:378:| 2 | **Janitor** | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (read + write) | First demoable inside-the-ATS result; day-30 before/after report closes deals |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:386:**Do not build out of order.** The Ultraplan §9 sequence is deliberate: Diagnostic before Janitor because Diagnostic needs no Bullhorn, and Bullhorn is the critical path. Janitor before Scribe because Janitor is a one-shot batch (easier first agent) and Scribe is webhook-driven (harder runtime integration). Cash Conductor in week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (per user memory — verify, don't assume).
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:137:#### R9. The Janitor — the database becomes an asset
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:242:| **Solo** (1–4 fee earners) | £499 | Janitor + 1 always-on agent (drafts-only) + Scribe | "Pay back the year inside one extra placement. Save 10+ hours/week of inbox and admin drag." |

docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:279:        │   The Scribe captures    │    │  The Janitor keeps it    │
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:344:- Janitor runs against the ATS — produces the day-1 cleanup report.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:430:**1. Every agent now has a quantified revenue story, not just a time-saved story.** The internal business plan and the 24/7 directive had revenue stories for some agents (Cash Conductor, Client Hunter, T5) but not all. Triage was pitched on responsiveness; here it's pitched on "2–4 additional placements/year per consultant from never-lost candidates". Janitor was pitched on database hygiene; here it's pitched on "one reactivated dormant-but-clean candidate per month covers the tier price".
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:458:- **No free pilots beyond the structured 14-day Janitor cleanup trial.** Free pilots train customers to expect free.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:472:- The Janitor (the wedge agent; lowest risk, highest visible value)
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:530:9. **The Janitor** — "Your sourcing runs become 3× more productive against clean data."
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:184:- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — Janitor found a high-confidence dedup candidate requiring human review
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:239:- Scheduled agents (Janitor, Reporting, Spec Pitcher) run as cron jobs *also* under the tenant's OS user.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:759:- Week 5: Janitor agent; day-30 before/after report template; CI fixtures
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:762:Milestone: Janitor produces an audit report against a real Bullhorn (the first pilot's, ideally). Scribe processes 10 real calls.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:799:4. Janitor's Workflow F (the day-30 before/after report) — can be manually compiled for the first tenant
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:818:| 2 | Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week | High | High | End of week 3 status not "core read endpoints working" | Pre-emptive: spend week 0 on Bullhorn auth research. Contingency: defer Janitor and Scribe to weeks 7–8, push Concierge to v1.1 |
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:824:| 8 | First pilot's Bullhorn data is too messy for Janitor's dedup confidence threshold | Medium | Medium | <5% dedup proposed in week 6 trial run | Lower threshold to 0.7 for the initial cleanup; ship the day-30 report regardless |
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:829:| 13 | The Bullhorn API rate limits prevent Janitor from completing its initial sweep on day 1 | Medium | Medium | First sweep takes >24 hours | Initial sweep runs in batches over 3 days; communicate to tenant explicitly |

1. Gate A and dedup review-band semantics contradict each other. Line 18 says Gate A hard-fails merge proposals below `0.85`, while lines 18, 59, 71, and 202 define a `0.70-0.85` review band held for Telegram approval; then line 106 says pairs below `0.85` are discarded. This makes the output contract and workflow unimplementable as written. Fix by choosing one model: either no sub-0.85 merge proposals, or amend Gate A/catalogue to explicitly allow review-only sub-0.85 proposals.

2. `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` is repurposed beyond the catalogue definition. Lines 202 and 228 claim the code covers `0.70-0.85` pairs and `>=0.85` pairs with recent Bullhorn activity, but `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` lines 127-132 define it as `Dedup confidence >= 0.85` human-review cases with candidate-only payload fields. Fix the agent.md to match the catalogue, or amend the catalogue first with contractor/review-band semantics.

3. §4 does not satisfy the required `hh_decision_*` coverage. Line 81 states every output/action step must call `hh_decision_*`, but Step 1 refreshes Bullhorn auth and can enter degraded/blocking state without an audit call (lines 89-92), and Steps 3-4 perform dedup decisioning without their own output/action audit until Step 9 (lines 103-114). Fix by adding explicit `hh_decision_output/action` rows at each action-producing or gate-producing step, including auth refresh and dedup review/drop outcomes.

4. §4 workflow steps do not consistently reference a declared `tools.yaml` capability or `_shared/` helper. The type-specific skill requires each workflow step to cite one; Steps 3-4 define a fuzzy matcher inline (lines 103-114) rather than referencing a planned tool/helper, and Step 6 references `companies_house.search` plus `tools.yaml` cache behavior without naming the concrete capability contract (lines 125-130). Fix by naming the exact tools.yaml capability or extracting/reusing a shared matcher/helper before this contract ratifies.
