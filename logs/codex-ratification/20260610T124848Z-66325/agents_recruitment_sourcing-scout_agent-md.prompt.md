=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing

**Status:** Proposed.
**Build state:** W9 build slice COMPLETE (spec-003; branch `worktree-agent-a45354564e8f66257`, 2026-06-10) — all 6 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures LIVE; build-gate GREEN; three deterministic DB-backed fixture suites green. Prior contract history: Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fix; R9 added §10 three-state lifecycle clarification (Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted → In Force; ratification ≠ acceptance per agent-bundle skill) + §4 Step 8 + Schema-key block rewrite for `blocked_recipients`; R19 (2026-05-24) added the `blocked_recipients` declaration to v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions per Codex Finding 1. Still awaits: Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decision B (Sub-decision A RESOLVED 2026-06-02 per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` — direct API per-tenant OAuth; marketplace deferred to v1.1+) + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups (creds EMPTY; live smoke founder-gated) + Codex re-ratification of the built bundle + founder approvals per §10.
**Reading-discipline note (updated 2026-06-10 at W9 build; originally added 2026-06-03 per CC + Concierge + Janitor + Scribe precedent):** this `agent.md` is the **CONTRACT** that the W9 build slice implemented against. The 6 sibling bundle files (`cycle.sh` + `validate.sh` + `context.sh` + `cleanup.sh` + `tools.yaml` + `README.md`) + 3 fixtures are **LIVE** — the W9 build slice (spec-003, this branch) replaced every `TODO(W9)` marker with live implementation; three deterministic DB-backed fixture suites (`scripts/run-scout-{dedupe,gate-a,degraded}-test.sh`) are green under build-gate. **Per-component build state, honestly stated:** `@ifos/bullhorn` — implemented connector package (`packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn`); the Sourcing-Scout OAuth CLI bridge is not built and creds are EMPTY → cycle.sh Step 2 degraded-skip. `@ifos/reed` — implemented connector package (`packages/mcp-connectors/reed`, v0.1.0, tests green); creds EMPTY → degraded-skip until founder signup. `@ifos/cv-library` — implemented connector package + built `dist/cli.js` bridge (`packages/mcp-connectors/cv-library`, v0.1.0); the designated v1.0 live source, but creds EMPTY at last names-only verification → live smoke founder-gated. None of the three is production-proven: no live API call has been made by this bundle; all coverage is fixture-driven (`IFOS_SCOUT_FIXTURE_*`). **VENDOR NOTE:** the v1.0 contract is THREE active sources (Bullhorn + Reed + CV-Library); LinkedIn is structurally present as an explicit NO-OP only — cycle.sh Step 4 emits `linkedin_query` (`results:0; no_op`) per the Janitor Step 7 NO-OP pattern; vendor selection deferred to v1.1+ per the caveat at lines 6-8. **Live audit-marker set emitted by cycle.sh:** `session_start`, `brief_ingested`, `auth_refresh_complete`, `bullhorn_query`, `linkedin_query` (no-op), `reed_query`, `cvlibrary_query`, `aggregate_dedupe`, `dnc_filter`, `candidate_proposed` (one row PER candidate), `scout_report`, `scout_run_complete`, plus `validate_gate_a_fail` (Gate A failure only) and `operator_notify_telegram` (when configured). Pure read+report agent — no yellow/orange/red action_types; the only cleanup action_type is `sourcing_scout_cleanup` (green; still QUEUED for autosend-policy registration — `cleanup.sh` emits `hh_decision_output` until it lands). `context.sh` uses the canonical `tenant_adapters` SELECT path (with `IFOS_FORCE_*` fixture fallbacks retained for tests) — `bullhorn_corporation_id` v0.4-allowlisted (LIVE on VPS commit `a1bbcf6`) + `blocked_recipients` v0.3-allowlisted (LIVE on VPS). §10 lifecycle status remains **Proposed** pending Codex re-ratification of the built bundle + founder approvals — the status flip is founder-gated.

**v1.0 readiness caveat — LinkedIn deep-data vendor (added 2026-06-02):** the original v1.0 design listed **Proxycurl** as the LinkedIn deep-data source (one of FOUR sources in the §1 output contract). **Proxycurl was shut down in 2025** following LinkedIn's January 2025 lawsuit against Nubela (Proxycurl's parent; ~50% of their revenue came from LinkedIn scraping; see https://nubela.co/blog/goodbye-proxycurl/). The successor product **NinjaPear** (same team) explicitly does NOT carry LinkedIn data — it is a B2B competitive-intelligence platform sourced from non-LinkedIn channels. Net: the LinkedIn-via-Proxycurl path in the original four-source design **does not have a legally-clear vendor as of 2026-06-02**; §1 + §3 + §4 Step 4 + §6 below are written to the three-source v1.0 contract with LinkedIn as an explicit NO-OP row.

**v1.0 disposition (per founder decision 2026-06-02):** LinkedIn deep-data is **DEFERRED to v1.1+**. v1.0 Sourcing Scout operates against **THREE active sources** (Bullhorn-candidate passive-match + Reed + CV-Library), not four. The §1 output contract's "5-15 candidates" Gate A target is preserved; Reed + CV-Library + Bullhorn passive-match combined are sufficient at v1.0 pilot scale (≤3 tenants). LinkedIn-vendor selection for v1.1+ takes place at W8-9 when the Sourcing Scout build slice forces the choice and we have more clarity on the post-lawsuit legal landscape (candidate vendors: Lix, Phantombuster, Apify with LinkedIn-aware contracts, or LinkedIn's own Sales Navigator enterprise API at much higher cost). Until that decision: §4 Step 4 (LinkedIn search) is an explicit structurally-present NO-OP in v1.0; the ranked-list assembly at Step 6 weights the 3 active sources accordingly; the §3 output template still shows the LinkedIn row but populates it as "deferred to v1.1+; vendor pending" rather than a scraped result. Gate B target (≥6 of 10 advance per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553) unchanged at v1.0 — the marginal contribution of LinkedIn deep-data is unknown until pilot data lands; v1.1+ vendor selection partly informed by whether Gate B underperforms without it.

**Schema-key references:**
- `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — registered in `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (key at line 434; `allowed_keys` array lines 432-445; element-type validation block lines 510-523); canonical Postgres-backed v1.0 DNC source per ADR-002. Declared in `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` lines 823-840 (R19 added this declaration; no longer deferred).
- `tenant_adapters.config.auto_source_on_brief_create` — v0.4-supplement-pending (not yet in any allowlist); the Bullhorn-webhook auto-source trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 lands.
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from THREE active v1.0 sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API) — LinkedIn is structurally present as an explicit NO-OP row only (deferred to v1.1+ per the vendor caveat above; §4 Step 4 emits `linkedin_query` with `results:0; no_op`). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button OR Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`). Bullhorn "new brief" webhook auto-source (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547) is DEFERRED to v1.1+ — blocked on `auto_source_on_brief_create` config key landing in a v0.4 supplement. Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Brain UI (v1.0 primary)

Brain UI v1.0 "Source candidates" button on any brief detail page → POST internal API → Sourcing Scout webhook.

### Telegram command (v1.0)

```
@ifos_bot scout <brief-id-or-slug>
@ifos_bot scout --description "Senior React engineer, London, £120k, hybrid"
```

### Webhook (DEFERRED to v1.1+)

Bullhorn "new brief created" webhook → routed via internal bus → Sourcing Scout if tenant config enables `auto_source_on_brief_create`. v0.4-supplement-pending (config key not yet registered); webhook-trigger code path is BLOCKED until v0.4 supplement lands. v1.0 invocation is Brain UI button + Telegram only.

### CLI (v1.0 — debugging)

```bash
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --brief-id <id>
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --description "<free-text>"
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Night Sourcer Tier-1 always-on (Brain UI dashboard; cortextOS primitive #6)
- Bulk-source mode (`--brief-list briefs.csv`)
- Refresh-source mode (re-source against the same brief 30 days later)

---

## §3 — Output shape

One output per invocation. Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`. Structure:

**Source:** Bullhorn (passive match) | **Contact:** <method + verified>
**Match rationale:**
<≥50 words explaining why this candidate is a match — references brief
requirements + candidate background; cites Bullhorn placement history,
LinkedIn current role, or other source-specific evidence.>
**Risk flags:** <e.g., "active with placement at competitor agency 2024";
"prefers contract not perm per Bullhorn note">
**Profile links:** [Bullhorn](url) | [LinkedIn](url)

### 2. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.88
...

(5-15 candidates total)

## Source breakdown
| Source | Candidates contributed | Avg confidence | Rate-limit budget remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bullhorn ATS | <N> | <score> | n/a (no quota) |
| LinkedIn | 0 (NO-OP; deferred to v1.1+; vendor pending) | — | — |
| Reed | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| CV-Library | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |

## Diagnostic + exception list
- <Any source failures (e.g., "Reed API 429; retried once; 3 candidates lost")>
- <Any "do not contact" filter hits>
- <Any low-confidence candidates discarded (below 0.5)>
```

Per `decision_log`: one row per source query + one row per candidate proposed + one final aggregate row.

Voice-classified content: only the per-candidate match rationale (Step 9). Voice classifier ≥0.75 against tenant style. Rationale that fails after 3 retries → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT → candidate dropped from list + flagged in exception list.

## §4 — Workflow

11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-
     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
     registered config key)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")

1. Brief ingestion
   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
     "key_dims:<N>")

2. Multi-source auth refresh
   → bullhorn (read-only); Reed; CV-Library. LinkedIn: NO auth at v1.0
     (Step 4 is a NO-OP; vendor deferred to v1.1+)
   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
       enters degraded mode per catalogue ("drafts-only, no auto-send" —
       Sourcing-Scout-specific interpretation: skip Bullhorn source +
       continue with the other 2 active sources, since Sourcing Scout has
       no auto-send path of its own; the "drafts-only" framing maps to
       "report-only with Bullhorn data omitted from the sourcing set")
     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
       Reed search results only)
     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (cached CV-Library search only)
     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): NOT fired at v1.0 — reserved
       for the v1.1+ LinkedIn vendor integration
   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>; linkedin:v1.0_no_op")

3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
     modification recency within the active set.
   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

4. LinkedIn search — explicit NO-OP at v1.0 (deferred to v1.1+)
   → structurally present per the Janitor Step 7 NO-OP pattern: emits an
     empty result set into the Step 7 aggregate; the §3 report shows the
     LinkedIn row as "deferred to v1.1+; vendor pending"
   → no vendor call, no cache, no auth, no ESC at v1.0 (Proxycurl shut
     down 2025 per the v1.0 readiness caveat; v1.1+ vendor selection
     pending — Lix / Phantombuster / Apify / Sales Navigator)
   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>",
     "results:0; no_op; reason:v1.0_caveat_proxycurl_shutdown;
      vendor_selection:v1.1_deferred")

5. Reed query
   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='reed')
   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

6. CV-Library query
   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

7. Aggregate + dedupe
   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + Reed
     match" if found in both)
   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")

8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients`
     (concept referenced by autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
     `send_to_blocked_recipient` action_type + ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT catalogue
     §2.10; the config key IS registered in the canonical authority
     `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (key at line 434;
     `allowed_keys` array lines 432-445; element-type validation block
     lines 510-523).
     v0.4-pending status applies ONLY to `auto_source_on_brief_create`
     (the webhook auto-source trigger config), NOT to `blocked_recipients`.
     Postgres-backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — NOT vault markdown.
     `blocked_recipients` is now declared in `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml`
     lines 823-840.)
   → remove any candidate matching any DNC identifier from the sourcing list
   → log dropped candidates to exception list in §3 output
   → NOTE: ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT is catalogue §2.10 reserved for OUTBOUND SEND
     REFUSAL specifically. Sourcing Scout filters DNC matches AT SOURCING
     TIME (pre-outbound); no outbound send attempt occurs. v0.3 disposition:
     log DNC drops in exception list only; no ESC fire. W4-polish backlog:
     add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER for the pre-outbound case.
   → hh_decision_output("dnc_filter", "brief:<id>",
     "dropped:<N>; kept:<N>")

9. LLM ranking + rationale generation (per candidate)
   → for top 15 by source-aggregated confidence: generate per-candidate
     rationale ≥50 words
   → prompt = (brief context + candidate profile + voice corpus + tone rules)
   → voice classifier scores rationale (≥0.75)
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries; drop candidate
     from final list
   → hh_decision_output("candidate_proposed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id|external_ref>",
     "source:<bullhorn|linkedin|reed|cvlibrary>; confidence:<N>; voice_score:<N>; included:<bool>") — emitted PER CANDIDATE per §3 contract (one row per candidate proposed; dropped candidates also get a row with included=false + drop_reason)

10. Output assembly + Gate A validation
    → ensure 5-15 candidates remaining after Step 9
    → ensure each has working contact method (email validated via simple
      regex + domain MX check; phone validated via E.164 format)
    → ensure each rationale ≥50 words
    → if any condition fails: write partial draft to /tmp, then emit the
      mandatory audit row hh_decision_action("validate_gate_a_fail",
      "brief:<id>", payload_hash, "ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE; <failed_condition>")
      — output-shape violation per catalogue line 184 (distinct from
      ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION, reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint
      violations at write time; audit row mandatory per master brief §8.1
      Change 2 + autosend-policy.yaml lines 119-123) — then abort (exit 1)
      BEFORE the scout_report row below
    → write Markdown report to vault path per §3
    → hh_decision_output("scout_report", report_path, "N candidates from M sources")

11. Session close + notification
    → operator notification per invocation source (Brain UI: in-app
      notification; Telegram: reply with report path; webhook: bus event back)
    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):

- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text → fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (BLOCKING per catalogue §2.5 lines 148-154; halts immediately, not warn-only output-shape)
- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)

Gate A failure routing by class:
- PII leakage → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall)
- Output-shape failures (count not in 5-15, contact-method missing, rationale <50 words, voice classifier miss, all-source-failure-without-degradation) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
On any Gate A failure, `validate.sh` writes the partial draft to `/tmp` and emits the mandatory `hh_decision_action("validate_gate_a_fail", ...)` audit row carrying the ESC code (per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-policy.yaml lines 119-123) BEFORE aborting; operator review.

**Build note (updated 2026-06-10; the original Cat-5 honesty note said `validate.sh` did not exist yet):** `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` is now LIVE — delivered by the W9 build slice (spec-003 §5) implementing G1-G7 against the contract above, exercised by `scripts/run-scout-gate-a-test.sh` (PASS + 9 fail classes; deterministic DB-backed fixtures). Not yet production-proven: no live run has occurred (creds EMPTY; live smoke founder-gated).

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.

Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply (v1.0). Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant. NOTE: Bullhorn-note feedback is NOT a v1.0 path (Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn per §1 + §6 contracts; would require write capability not in v1.0 scope).

Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).

Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | v1.1+ LinkedIn vendor session/OAuth fail — NOT fired at v1.0 (§4 Step 4 is an explicit NO-OP; no vendor) | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / reed / cv-library; linkedin reserved for v1.1+) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |

Sourcing Scout does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
- **Voice-drift detection (classifier-only):** per `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` lines 597-606 (§2a access-list amendment) + 728-737 (access matrix), Sourcing Scout has `recent_edit` access of **W** (writes its rationale drafts) but **not R**, so it does NOT read consultant edit history via `hh_load_recent_edits`. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. The cron — not Sourcing Scout — reads edit history for analytics + canary threshold tuning.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W9 prerequisites — table updated 2026-06-10 post-W9-build)

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified | Week 3 Codex Round 4 | ⏸ |
| Janitor ratified (Bullhorn-read substrate) | W5 Codex Round | ⏸ |
| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted** | Sub-decision A RESOLVED 2026-06-02; B pending | ⏸ |
| Bullhorn MCP read capability | `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn` package exists; Sourcing-Scout OAuth CLI bridge + creds pending → Step 2 degraded-skip | ⏸ (partial) |
| **LinkedIn vendor selection + commercial signup** (Proxycurl shut down 2025) | Founder commercial, v1.1+ | DEFERRED v1.1+ |
| **Reed.co.uk commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial (creds EMPTY) | ⏸ |
| **CV-Library commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial (creds EMPTY at last names-only verification) | ⏸ |
| LinkedIn vendor MCP connector | v1.1+ after vendor selection | DEFERRED v1.1+ |
| Reed MCP connector | `packages/mcp-connectors/reed` v0.1.0, tests green | ✅ (creds EMPTY) |
| CV-Library MCP connector | `packages/mcp-connectors/cv-library` v0.1.0 + `dist/cli.js` bridge | ✅ (creds EMPTY; live smoke founder-gated) |
| Source-abstraction layer (Night Sourcer reuse) | `_scout_query_source()` in cycle.sh (W9 build slice) | ✅ (ADR per §9 Q6 still to be authored) |
| Per-tenant source credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Tenant DNC list populated in `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-backed structured state per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | W9 build slice (spec-003 §5; G1-G7) | ✅ |
| `context.sh` hydration | W9 build slice (canonical `tenant_adapters` SELECTs) | ✅ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (11-step) | W9 build slice (spec-003 §4) | ✅ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | W9 build slice + 3 DB-backed test suites | ✅ |

**Post-W9-build note:** the four sibling-bundle deliverables (validate.sh, context.sh, cycle.sh, fixtures) WERE the W9 build slice and are delivered on this branch; the W9 build proceeded against deterministic fixtures per spec-003 §8 honest scope. The remaining ⏸ rows are FOUNDER/TENANT-ADMIN actions (commercial signups, creds, DNC population, voice corpus, ratifications) — they gate the first LIVE run and the §10 lifecycle transitions (Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted), not the fixture-backed build.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed (W9 build slice COMPLETE on this branch — bundle LIVE per the build-state header; §10 status flip is founder-gated). Awaits Bullhorn Sub-decision B + 2 commercial signups (Reed + CV-Library; LinkedIn vendor deferred to v1.1+) + Q1 LOI + Codex re-ratification + founder approvals per §10.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | All three v1.0 sources required? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; LinkedIn deep-data is deferred to v1.1+ post-Proxycurl-shutdown. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + one job board only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
| Q2 | LinkedIn vendor pricing (v1.1+) — the original Proxycurl model (~$39/mo for 5,000 credits, ~$20-50/day at peak per consultant) is void post-shutdown. Per-tenant budget cap for the v1.1+ vendor? | Deferred to v1.1+ vendor selection (Lix / Phantombuster / Apify / Sales Navigator); cost ceiling per brief remains the design constraint whichever vendor is chosen. |
| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback (Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet) | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful" → `decision_log` row via `consultant_feedback` green-tier action_type. v1.1: Brain UI button. NOTE: Bullhorn-note-based feedback is NOT a v1.0 path — Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn (no write capability); Bullhorn note creation would require tools.yaml write capability + autosend/decision logging which v1.0 explicitly excludes. |
| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. A new ADR (number assigned at authoring time; not ADR-006 — that's Diagnostic Gate A) at W9 build start documenting the source-abstraction interface. |
| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)

1. **LinkedIn vendor rate limits (v1.1+).** The original Proxycurl per-credit quota model is void post-shutdown; the underlying constraint stands — deep profile fetches cost more than searches, so plan a cost ceiling per brief for whichever v1.1+ vendor is selected.
2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built 2026-05-24, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED verdict on the SCAFFOLD shape (output contract + workflow + gates + escalation + dependencies). **Ratification of the scaffold does NOT make it Accepted.** Per the agent-bundle skill, Accepted means production-ready — which requires all sibling bundle files + fixtures + first production run.

**Three-state lifecycle:**

1. **Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold** when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED on this agent.md alone. Pre-build scaffold confirmed shape-correct; the document is a binding contract for the W9 build slice.

2. **Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted** when ALL:
   - W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files (`tools.yaml`, `context.sh`, `validate.sh`, `cycle.sh`, `cleanup.sh`) + 3 fixtures with golden outputs
   - Codex re-ratifies the full bundle (agent.md + siblings + fixtures) post-build
   - Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
   - Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
   - Q6: source-abstraction-layer ADR drafted + ratified (new ADR — not the same as ADR-006 which is Diagnostic Gate A; number assigned at authoring time)

3. **Accepted → In Force** when:
   - First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
   - Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram /scout-feedback path; Brain UI in v1.1)
   - First production render against a pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)

Until W9 build: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.
