=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Cash Conductor — the FD's evenings back

**Status:** Proposed (Day-18 pre-W7-8-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 598 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A4 line 531 (both say W7-8; consistent).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540.
**Tier:** Tier 1 (persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks + cron sweep) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 532.
**Hire #1 anchor:** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7". First sprint for Hire #1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 strategic-value rationale; Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are yellow-tier `xero_reminder_draft_internal` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 182-187 — internal draft sampled for spot-check); the customer-facing send routed via Concierge is orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 257-262; consultant approval required before send). Reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Webhook (v1.0 primary path)

```http
POST https://<tenant>.ifos.app/agents/cash-conductor/webhook
Authorization: Bearer <provider-shared-secret>
Content-Type: application/json

# Event types (per provider):
# - Xero/QuickBooks/Sage: invoice.created, invoice.sent, invoice.viewed,
#   invoice.paid, payment.received
# - Open Banking (TrueLayer/Plaid UK): transaction.posted, balance.updated
```

Per-provider webhook auth handled in `tools.yaml`.

### Cron (daily reconciliation sweep)

```bash
# 07:00 UTC daily — bank feed catch-up + invoice age scan
0 7 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-cash-conductor.sh --tenant <slug> --mode daily-sweep
```

### Weekly report cron

```bash
# Monday 06:00 UTC — cash-flow report regeneration
0 6 * * 1 sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-cash-conductor.sh --tenant <slug> --mode weekly-report
```

### Manual triggers (v1.0)

```bash
ifosctl cash-conductor reconcile --tenant <slug> [--invoice <id>]
ifosctl cash-conductor draft-chase --tenant <slug> --invoice <id>
ifosctl cash-conductor weekly-report --tenant <slug>
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI cash-flow dashboard
- Per-tenant Telegram daily summary
- FD-mode end-of-month report (more detailed than weekly)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Three outputs. All load-bearing.

### Output 1 — Reconciliation rows (yellow tier)

Per webhook event, Cash Conductor reconciles incoming bank deposits against the tenant's open invoice register. Match algorithm:

| Stage | Match dimensions | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Exact amount + matching invoice reference in transaction memo | 0.98 |
| 2 | Exact amount + matching payee name | 0.85 |
| 3 | Exact amount + within-90-day-of-invoice-issue window | 0.70 |
| 4 | Fuzzy amount (±0.5% rounding) + matching payee name | 0.65 |
| 5 | Unmatched (queued for review) | <0.50 |

Stages 1-2 auto-write reconciliation to accounting system (yellow tier; spot-check sampled). Stages 3-4 queue for consultant review. Stage 5 flagged in weekly report.

Each reconciliation write: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='accounting_reconciliation_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes match confidence + match dimensions.

### Output 2 — Payment-chase drafts (orange tier)

For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. Output is a queued draft, NOT a send. Drafts route to Concierge (which handles the actual send pipeline + consultant approval per autosend §4 orange tier).

Chase draft structure:

```yaml
draft_id: <uuid>
invoice_id: <accounting-system-invoice-id>
contact_email: <client-billing-contact-email>
subject: "Friendly reminder — invoice <number> from <YYYY-MM-DD>"
body_markdown: <voice-classified consultant-tone reminder>
amount_due: <decimal>
days_overdue: <int>
prior_chases_sent: <int>
escalation_ladder_position: 1-4 per §3.2 below
expected_send_window: orange-tier approval expected within 24h
```

Each draft: `decision_log` row `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_draft_internal'` (registered yellow tier — but Cash Conductor escalates to orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` for the actual customer-facing send routed via Concierge; this row is the draft itself, not the send), payload includes the draft.

### §3.2 — Chase escalation ladder

| Position | Trigger | Tone | Voice classifier minimum |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 7 days overdue | "Friendly reminder, hope everything's OK on your end" | ≥0.75 |
| 2 | 14 days overdue, position-1 sent | "Following up — please let us know if there's a query" | ≥0.75 |
| 3 | 21 days overdue, position-2 sent | "Need to flag this; can we schedule a quick call?" | ≥0.80 (higher bar) |
| 4 | 30 days overdue, position-3 sent | "Escalation to operator review" — drafts STOP; operator manual handle | n/a (not sent) |

Position 4 is the kill-switch: Cash Conductor never auto-drafts beyond position 3. Operator decides next step manually.

### Output 3 — Weekly cash-flow Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md`. Generated Monday 06:00 UTC. Six sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Week summary** | Receipts received + invoices issued + invoices paid + new chases sent |
| 2 | **DSO trend** | Days-Sales-Outstanding metric this week vs prior-week vs month-0 baseline; Gate B tracking |
| 3 | **Aged debtors** | Invoices outstanding bucketed (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days); per-client totals |
| 4 | **Chase pipeline** | Active chase drafts by position 1-3; pending consultant approval; sent-but-no-response |
| 5 | **Cash-flow forecast** | 4-week forward cash projection (open invoices + expected payments per historical conversion rate) |
| 6 | **Exception list** | Reconciliation failures; bank-feed gaps; accounting-API failures; operator action items |

---

## §4 — Workflow

14 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start (webhook OR cron OR manual)
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + accounting-provider auth +
     Open Banking auth + voice corpus + tone rules
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "<webhook|cron|manual>")

1. Provider auth refresh
   → accounting: Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh per provider
   → Open Banking: TrueLayer/Plaid UK 90-day token refresh (CRITICAL —
     gotcha per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541); staged ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING:
     ≤30d info, ≤14d warn, ≤7d blocking (operator must re-authorise)
   → ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH or ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH on auth failure
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "accounting:<ok|fail>; open_banking:<ok|fail>; token_aging_stage:<info|warn|blocking|fresh>")

2. Event router (mode-dependent)
   → if mode=webhook: parse event_type → routes to Step 3-7 path
   → if mode=daily-sweep: routes to Step 4 (invoice ingest) → Step 5 (reconciliation) → Step 7 (chase generation pass) catch-up sequence; sweeps run the full reconciliation-first-then-chase pipeline
   → if mode=weekly-report: skip to Step 13

3. Bank transaction ingest (mode=webhook from Open Banking)
   → fetch latest transactions since last_ingested_at
   → normalise schema (TrueLayer vs Plaid have different formats)
   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_transactions` (RLS-isolated per
     tenant per Day-4 §6.3 + tenancy-invariants T1-T3; W7 build slice creates
     the table per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres,
     not vault markdown)
   → hh_decision_output("transactions_ingested", "tenant:<slug>",
     "<N> rows since <last_ingested_at>")

4. Invoice register ingest (mode=webhook from accounting OR daily-sweep)
   → accounting.list_open_invoices() per provider
   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_invoices` (RLS-isolated;
     W7 build slice creates per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
   → hh_decision_output("invoices_ingested", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> rows")

5. Reconciliation pass (5-stage match algorithm per §3 Output 1)
   → for each transaction × open invoice: compute match confidence
   → write Stage 1-2 matches to accounting (yellow tier) atomically
   → queue Stage 3-4 matches for consultant review (ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS
     per stage)
   → flag Stage 5 (unmatched) in weekly-report exception list
   → hh_decision_output("reconciliation_pass", "tenant:<slug>",
     "stage1_2:<N>; stage3_4:<N>; stage5:<N>")

6. Reconciliation write (yellow tier; per match)
   → accounting.write_payment_received(invoice_id, payment_id, amount, date)
   → atomic transaction; rollback on 4xx/5xx
   → on success: hh_decision_action("accounting_reconciliation_write",
     "invoice:<id>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → on failure: ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL
   → spot-check sampling per autosend-safety-policy.yaml yellow tier

7. Chase generation pass (for overdue, unmatched invoices)
   → query open invoices with age >7 days AND no Stage-1/2 reconciliation
   → for each, determine chase position 1-4 based on age + prior chases
     sent (read from `cash_conductor_invoices.last_chase_position` — v0.3
     schema-backed field per migration §3; NOT from decision_log payload)
   → if position=4: STOP — operator review (no auto-draft)
   → else: proceed to Step 8

8. LLM chase-draft generation (per overdue invoice)
   → prompt = (invoice details + client context + position-N tone +
     voice corpus + tone rules)
   → output = email body + subject
   → voice classifier scores against tenant style (≥0.75 for position 1-2;
     ≥0.80 for position 3 per §3.2)
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <threshold after 3 retries
   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_generated", "invoice:<id>",
     "position:<N>; voice_score:<N>; words:<N>")

9. Chase-draft validation (Gate A specifics)
   → verify: invoice_number cited matches invoice_id
   → verify: amount_due cited matches accounting record
   → verify: client_contact_email matches active billing contact
   → verify: NOT paid in last 24h (re-query accounting)
   → ESC code mapping by failure class:
     - invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition mismatch →
       `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint failure)
     - client_contact_email / addressee mismatch (chase routed to wrong
       customer) → `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (per catalogue §2.10 — explicitly
       blocking for Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee resolution)
     `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` is reserved for red-tier action attempts per
     catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's chase pipeline is orange-tier.
   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_validated", invoice_id, "passed")

10. Chase-draft queue to Concierge (orange tier)
    → POST internal API → Concierge agent receives draft
    → Concierge handles autosend-bridge call to operator (D1 path per
      Founder Decision)
    → hh_decision_action("xero_reminder_draft_internal", "invoice:<id>",
      payload_hash, payload_preview); tier=yellow internal-draft; the
      customer-facing send (orange tier) happens in Concierge as
      `xero_reminder_send_customer` after operator approval

11. (Operator approves via Concierge → Concierge sends → Cash Conductor
    records send event)
    → Concierge fires webhook back: chase_sent
    → Cash Conductor updates internal state: prior_chases_sent counter

12. (Mode=webhook only) Re-trigger eligibility check
    → was this webhook also a "payment received" that just hit?
    → re-run Step 5 to check if any chases-in-flight should be cancelled
      (paid-since-draft-but-before-send race condition)
    → if so: ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE → cancel chase draft (do NOT send)
    → hh_decision_output("chase_cancellation_check", "invoice:<id>",
      "cancelled:<bool>")

13. Weekly report assembly (mode=weekly-report; runs Monday 06:00 UTC)
    → query decision_log + accounting + bank feed for the 7-day window
    → compute DSO metric (Gate B tracking)
    → 6-section Markdown report per §3 Output 3
    → write to /vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md
    → hh_decision_output("weekly_report", report_path,
      "dso_delta_days:<N>; sections:6")

14. Session close
    → update tenant_adapters.config.cash_conductor_last_run = now()
    → hh_decision_action("cash_conductor_run_complete", session_id,
      run_mode, payload_hash, payload_preview)
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Cash Conductor's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim):

- **"chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact"** (all three; AND not OR)
- **"never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h"** (defence-in-depth re-query at draft time)
- Voice classifier score ≥0.75 for position 1-2 chases; ≥0.80 for position 3
- No PII outside firm boundary in chase body
- Reconciliation match confidence ≥0.85 for auto-write (Stage 1-2 only)
- Open Banking token >30 days from expiry (otherwise warn)
- Accounting auth refresh succeeded in Step 1

Gate A failures fire either `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (invoice/amount/paid-precondition miss; output-shape constraint) OR `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (client_contact_email mismatch; blocking per catalogue §2.10 — explicit Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee case). Draft stays in `/tmp` (auto-purged 24h); operator notified per the specific ESC route.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Cash Conductor `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W7 build slice. The W7 build delivers `agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (FD-tier closer metric)

Per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim: **"tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline"**.

DSO = Days Sales Outstanding = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days.

Measured monthly via the weekly report's §2 trend. Month-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (before Cash Conductor active). Month-3 target = month-0 minus 12 days.

This is THE FD-tier closer metric per master brief §8.2 line 598 ("DSO drops by 15 days"; ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 sets the 12-day Gate B target — note minor drift from the master brief's 15-day pitch which is the more aggressive marketing position) — a local leading metric for Cash Conductor quality. Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Cash Conductor's DSO improvement is NOT directly mapped to a v1.0 kill-criterion trigger; it's tracked as a local Gate B signal. Below ≥12 days improvement for 2 consecutive months → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → founder + operator review (likely indicates heuristic tuning, escalation-ladder timing, OR tenant-specific late-payment patterns we haven't modelled).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Cash Conductor uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH` | Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL` | Accounting 4xx/5xx on reconciliation write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH` | TrueLayer/Plaid UK auth fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING` | Open Banking PSD2 consent approaching 90-day expiry (staged) | info ≤30d / warn ≤14d / **blocking** ≤7d (per catalogue §2.7) | operator_chat_id (info+warn); + ifos_oncall_chat_id at blocking stage |
| `ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS` | Stage 3-4 match queued for review | warn (per catalogue §2.10) | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE` | Payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Chase voice classifier below threshold after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in chase body | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A miss on invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition (NOT addressee mismatch — that uses ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` | Gate A miss on client_contact_email / addressee resolution (per catalogue §2.10 Cash Conductor case) | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | DSO improvement below 12-day target for 2 consecutive months | warn | founder + operator |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Accounting OR Open Banking 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING` | Chase draft awaiting consultant approval — heartbeat at ≥50% of declared timeout (per catalogue §2.9 trigger) | info | operator_chat_id (gentle reminder; no oncall CC) |

Cash Conductor does NOT use:

- Bullhorn-specific codes (no Bullhorn dependency)
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's red-tier per catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's pipeline is orange-tier (chase send) or yellow-tier (reconciliation write); Gate A misses fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Cash Conductor's Gate A misses are output-shape failures, not schema-field violations
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Cash Conductor fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (chase-draft generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `cash_conductor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "Final demand" or legal-threatening language (escalation ladder caps at position 3; position 4 is operator-handled)
  - No reference to the client's industry / sector pain points (chase is operational, not strategic)
  - No mentions of late-payment fees unless tenant's terms explicitly state them
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "professional polite chase email" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `cash_conductor` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the chase voice classifier score is below threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Cash Conductor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Cash Conductor.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §8 — Build dependencies (W7-8 prerequisites)

Cash Conductor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ |
| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
| **Tenant's accounting choice confirmed** (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| **Accounting commercial signup** (developer access + sandbox) | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
| **Open Banking commercial signup** (TrueLayer or Plaid UK) | Founder commercial; ~£100-300/mo | ⏸ |
| Xero MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| QuickBooks MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Sage MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days; may defer if no pilot uses Sage v1.0) | ⏸ |
| Open Banking MCP connector | W7 build start (~3 days; harder due to 90-day token rotation) | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant accounting credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant Open Banking credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Concierge agent.md ratified Accepted (for chase-send routing contract; full Concierge production-build at W10-13, but Cash Conductor only depends on the Concierge agent.md contract being Accepted, not the full bundle being In Force) | Post-Concierge agent.md re-ratification | ⏸ |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W7 start (~1 day; complex due to 4 validators) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W7 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (14-step) | Build at W7 start (~3 days; most complex of v1.0 agents) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W7 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**ADR-005 framing:** ADR-005 (Week-3 Diagnostic acceleration) notes Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips because it has zero Bullhorn dependency. v0.3 supplement: Cash Conductor pull-forward (from W7-8 to W4-5) is NOT explicitly authorised by ADR-005 §5.1 (that section number doesn't exist; earlier draft mis-cited). Pull-forward would require a separate ADR (e.g. ADR-007 if/when needed); accounting + Open Banking commercial signups remain founder-action gates regardless of timing.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7-8 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | First-tenant accounting choice — Xero / QuickBooks / Sage? Affects which connector is W7-prio-1. | Tenant onboarding; depends on first pilot tenant's existing stack. |
| Q2 | Open Banking provider — TrueLayer or Plaid UK? Both have UK coverage; TrueLayer slightly cheaper at low volume; Plaid has broader US-EU coverage for v1.1+ expansion. | Founder commercial. Recommend TrueLayer for v1.0 UK-only pilots. |
| Q3 | Open Banking 90-day token rotation UX — when token nears expiry, operator must re-authenticate via tenant's bank login. How is this triggered? Telegram nudge? Brain UI dashboard? | Recommend: ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING fires Telegram nudge at 30/14/7 days; tenant-admin handles via Brain UI v1.1. |
| Q4 | Chase escalation ladder — 4 positions proposed in §3.2. Founder confidence each position's timing + tone is right? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant's payment terms (net-30 vs net-14 vs net-60). |
| Q5 | Reconciliation Stage 3-4 (fuzzy / ambiguous matches) — consultant review queue UX. Brain UI workflow? Telegram? | v1.0: weekly report exception list. v1.1: Brain UI per-row review queue. |
| Q6 | DSO baseline establishment — month-0 baseline measured pre-deployment. How do we measure if accounting system data is incomplete or fragmented? | First pilot tenant: 30-day baseline measurement period BEFORE Cash Conductor goes live; documented in pilot LOI. |
| Q7 | Hire #1 anchor — what specific Cash Conductor sub-tasks does Hire #1 take vs Claude Code? | Founder strategic decision; recommend Hire #1 owns Open Banking connector + ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING UX. Cash Conductor agent.md + cycle.sh stays with founder + Claude Code for consistency with other agents. |
| Q8 | Sage connector — defer if no v1.0 pilot uses Sage? Saves ~2 days. Risk: blocks future Sage-using pilots. | Recommend defer to v1.1; document in W7 build start review. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541)

1. **Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial.** Plan for the rotation UX up-front; ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING staged at 30/14/7 days from expiry; document tenant-admin re-auth procedure.
2. **Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic.** Start with exact-amount matches (Stage 1-2); expand to fuzzy (Stage 3-4) as confidence builds.
3. **5 stages of match algorithm** is intentionally conservative for v1.0 to avoid false-positive reconciliation writes (which corrupt the tenant's accounting books).
4. **Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "verify, don't assume." If Hire #1 doesn't start on time, Cash Conductor build runs founder-solo and may slip.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q7 + Q8
- Q3 UX flow approved (operator re-auth path)

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W7-8 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production webhook processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- 30-day month-0 baseline measured for first pilot
- Hire #1 onboarded + integrated into the build workstream (per master brief §8.2 line 604)
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:1:# Cash Conductor — the FD's evenings back
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:3:**Status:** Proposed (Day-18 pre-W7-8-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7 build slice).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 598 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A4 line 531 (both say W7-8; consistent).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:8:**Tier:** Tier 1 (persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks + cron sweep) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 532.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:9:**Hire #1 anchor:** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7". First sprint for Hire #1.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 strategic-value rationale; Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are yellow-tier `xero_reminder_draft_internal` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 182-187 — internal draft sampled for spot-check); the customer-facing send routed via Concierge is orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 257-262; consultant approval required before send). Reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:74:Per webhook event, Cash Conductor reconciles incoming bank deposits against the tenant's open invoice register. Match algorithm:
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:86:Each reconciliation write: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='accounting_reconciliation_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes match confidence + match dimensions.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:90:For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. Output is a queued draft, NOT a send. Drafts route to Concierge (which handles the actual send pipeline + consultant approval per autosend §4 orange tier).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:107:Each draft: `decision_log` row `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_draft_internal'` (registered yellow tier — but Cash Conductor escalates to orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` for the actual customer-facing send routed via Concierge; this row is the draft itself, not the send), payload includes the draft.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:118:Position 4 is the kill-switch: Cash Conductor never auto-drafts beyond position 3. Operator decides next step manually.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:268:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Cash Conductor's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim):
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:278:Gate A failures fire either `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (invoice/amount/paid-precondition miss; output-shape constraint) OR `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (client_contact_email mismatch; blocking per catalogue §2.10 — explicit Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee case). Draft stays in `/tmp` (auto-purged 24h); operator notified per the specific ESC route.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:280:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Cash Conductor `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W7 build slice. The W7 build delivers `agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:284:Per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim: **"tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline"**.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:286:DSO = Days Sales Outstanding = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:288:Measured monthly via the weekly report's §2 trend. Month-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (before Cash Conductor active). Month-3 target = month-0 minus 12 days.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:290:This is THE FD-tier closer metric per master brief §8.2 line 598 ("DSO drops by 15 days"; ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 sets the 12-day Gate B target — note minor drift from the master brief's 15-day pitch which is the more aggressive marketing position) — a local leading metric for Cash Conductor quality. Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Cash Conductor's DSO improvement is NOT directly mapped to a v1.0 kill-criterion trigger; it's tracked as a local Gate B signal. Below ≥12 days improvement for 2 consecutive months → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → founder + operator review (likely indicates heuristic tuning, escalation-ladder timing, OR tenant-specific late-payment patterns we haven't modelled).

Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the chase voice classifier score is below threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Cash Conductor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Cash Conductor.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:338:## §8 — Build dependencies (W7-8 prerequisites)

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:363:**ADR-005 framing:** ADR-005 (Week-3 Diagnostic acceleration) notes Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips because it has zero Bullhorn dependency. v0.3 supplement: Cash Conductor pull-forward (from W7-8 to W4-5) is NOT explicitly authorised by ADR-005 §5.1 (that section number doesn't exist; earlier draft mis-cited). Pull-forward would require a separate ADR (e.g. ADR-007 if/when needed); accounting + Open Banking commercial signups remain founder-action gates regardless of timing.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:369:**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7-8 build slice start.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:386:1. **Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial.** Plan for the rotation UX up-front; ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING staged at 30/14/7 days from expiry; document tenant-admin re-auth procedure.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:389:4. **Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "verify, don't assume." If Hire #1 doesn't start on time, Cash Conductor build runs founder-solo and may slip.

docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:253:Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's assumption: **close the first three pilots fastest**. That means Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before Triage absorbs the development heat. Revise only if a hire's signed or a different pilot dynamic emerges.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:380:| 4 | **Cash Conductor** | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; the "DSO drops by 15 days" pitch |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:386:**Do not build out of order.** The Ultraplan §9 sequence is deliberate: Diagnostic before Janitor because Diagnostic needs no Bullhorn, and Bullhorn is the critical path. Janitor before Scribe because Janitor is a one-shot batch (easier first agent) and Scribe is webhook-driven (harder runtime integration). Cash Conductor in week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (per user memory — verify, don't assume).
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:22:- **D1-A: Become red in v1.0** — refuse all orange action_types entirely.

Master brief §8.2 line 604 acknowledges this contingency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:24:| A4 | Cash Conductor | 7-8 | Xero + Open Banking | "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:131:### 2.4 — A4 Cash Conductor
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:136:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First Tier-1 always-on agent** — exercises cortextOS **Primitive 1** (persistent PTY/PM2, flagged "shipped but flaky" in cortextos-primitive-status.md). First exercise of **Primitive 4** (approval gates) for chase email auto-send per master brief §8.2 line 604. First exercise of **Primitive 5** (Telegram approval surface) for FD-tier approval flow. **Does NOT touch Bullhorn** — independent integration path per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.2 (Cash Conductor uses Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking, not Bullhorn) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:137:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #1** (cortextOS primitives 1, 4, 5 — the three flagged "shipped but flaky" per cortextos-primitive-status.md). Critical gate for the v1.0 always-on agents that follow (Concierge) — if Cash Conductor surfaces primitive flakiness, the v1.0 scope-cut contingency (Ultraplan §10 row #1: degraded-mode fallback) activates before Concierge invests 4 weeks |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:138:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 604: "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'." Product Spec §2.2 R2: £40-120k working capital unlock per agency, "one bad debt caught per quarter pays for the entire suite" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:139:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** none on other agents (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking infra independent of Bullhorn path). **Downstream:** none in v1.0 (Cash Conductor's outputs are tenant-internal chase emails + DSO reports, not consumed by other v1.0 agents) | Low cross-agent coupling |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:142:**Hire-#1 anchor (per Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim):** "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)." Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking integration is the right scope for Hire #1's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 — this places Cash Conductor at W7-8 in the canonical sequence.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:165:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High (secondary)** | Second Tier-1 always-on agent (after Cash Conductor at W7-8) — provides Risk #1 secondary exercise. Exercises Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps per Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 verbatim ("Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks") |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:184:W7-8: Cash Conductor (A4) — Hire-#1-anchored per Ultraplan §9 line 766
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:194:- W7-8: Risk #1 (cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5) — Cash Conductor first Tier-1. Reduction trigger fires.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:202:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Excellent.** Cash Conductor at W7-8 matches Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim. Hire #1 (assumed W7) takes Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work as first sprint — well-scoped, independent of the Bullhorn track founder has been driving solo W3-W6.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:212:W12-13: Cash Conductor (A4)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:220:2. **Risk #1 derisk pushed to W12-13.** Cash Conductor's Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 first-exercise happens after Concierge's 4-week XL build. If Risk #1 materialises at W12-13, the entire v1.0 production-critical surface is at risk with no Hire-#1-takeover slot for Cash Conductor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:221:3. **Hire-#1 anchor broken.** Cash Conductor at W12-13 means Hire #1 (W7 start) has nothing to take on for 5 weeks. Hire #1's first sprint becomes "help with Concierge" — wrong scope for an onboarding sprint (Concierge is XL and founder-led).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:232:W11:  Cash Conductor (A4)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:236:**Why this ordering:** Front-load risk-de-risking by building Concierge (the most Primitive-heavy agent) early. Cash Conductor's Risk #1 exercise becomes redundant if Concierge already exercises Primitives 1+2+4+5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:242:3. **Hire-#1 anchor broken.** Cash Conductor at W11 is 4 weeks after Hire #1's assumed W7 start. Hire #1 again has no first-sprint scope.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:294:The Hire-#1 anchor at W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766 is load-bearing — Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work is well-scoped for Hire #1's first sprint. Beta and Gamma both displace Cash Conductor past W7-8 (W12-13 and W11 respectively), leaving Hire #1 with no first-sprint scope per §3.2 and §3.3 structural defects.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:307:**Trigger 2 — Risk #4 materialises (Hire #1 doesn't start by end of Week 4).** Per RISK-REGISTER #4 tripwire "No offer accepted by end of week 4":
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:311:- **Updates required:** same set as Trigger 1 plus founder's Q3 personal cadence (Cash Conductor's L/2-week build becomes founder solo at W7-8, slowing but not blocking).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:314:**Trigger 3 — Hire #1 starts later than Week 7.** Per Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim caveat: "Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)":
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:317:- **Activation:** Cash Conductor's W7-8 anchor slips. If Hire #1 starts W8 → Cash Conductor W8-9 (sequence preserved, just shifts right); if Hire #1 starts W9+ → Trigger 2 activates as fallback (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout).

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:238:| Placement | **v1.0** | Concierge (v1.0 A6) produces; Cash Conductor (v1.0 A4) reads for invoice context |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:239:| Contact (client-side individual) | **v1.0** | Cash Conductor needs invoice-recipient contacts; Scribe extracts decision-makers from calls; Concierge sends to named contacts. Modeled under `wiki/compiled/people/` |

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:751:v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic (no vault writes; sales-only), Janitor (heavy writes — nightly batch of thousands of Bullhorn entity updates), Scribe (per-call writes; ~30-60 min/day per consultant per Product Spec §2.2 R6), Cash Conductor (writes Placement updates on invoice events; reads heavily for invoice context), Sourcing Scout (read-heavy; produces drafts that the agent itself writes elsewhere), Concierge (per-lifecycle-event writes; reads candidate state on every inbound).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:773:| Cash Conductor | 10:1 | reads invoice + placement + client on every chase; writes only on event |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:778:**Peak concurrent agents per tenant (v1.0):** 4-5 — Janitor (nightly batch but daytime cleanup tasks too), Scribe (webhook-driven per-call), Cash Conductor (always-on watcher), Sourcing Scout (request-response), Concierge (always-on). At Boutique-tier these all run in one PM2 process group per tenant; at Scale-tier the same.

   562	**The bundle at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` is the source artefact; the cortextOS daemon does not read it directly.** The renderer (`packages/agent-renderer/`, per `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` and `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) translates the bundle into a cortextOS-shaped per-agent directory at `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` per-tenant. Source bundle authored once; rendered N times (once per active tenant). The `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command is **NOT** the IFOS path — it inherits 24 cortextOS template skills the IFOS bundle does not want.

   564	### 8.1 The three v2 changes (Ultraplan §4.2)
   565	
   566	**Change 1 — Voice handling moves into `_shared/voice-loader.sh`.** No agent reads the voice corpus directly. Every `context.sh` calls `hh_load_tone_rules`, `hh_load_voice_samples`, `hh_load_recent_edits`. Agent context scripts become 30 lines, not 200.
   567	
   568	**Change 2 — Decision logging is enforced.** Three required calls per agent run:
   569	
   570	```bash
   571	hh_decision_trigger   # at start; logs trigger
   572	hh_decision_output    # on output; logs the artefact
   573	hh_decision_action    # when human acts; logs the action
   574	```
   575	
   576	`validate.sh` hard-fails on missing calls. This is what enables the v2.0 LoRA pipeline — no decision log, no SFT corpus, no Scale-tier moat.
   577	
   578	**Change 3 — Escalation codes expand to recruitment vocabulary.** ~20–30 codes. Examples:
   579	
   580	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` — voice classifier score below threshold after retries
   581	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — OAuth token expired/revoked
   582	- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — high-confidence dedup needs human review
   583	- `ESC_JSL_RED_FLAG` — Supply Chain Auditor detected red flag
   584	- `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   585	- `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` — output references PII outside firm boundary
   586	- `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` — upstream API rate-limited (esp. LinkedIn)
   587	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — agent produced output violating vertical schema
   588	
   589	Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.
   590	
   591	### 8.2 The build order — v1.0 only
   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).
   605	
   606	### 8.3 The working pattern in Claude Code

   529	#### A4. Cash Conductor (real-time mode) — the FD's evenings back
   530	
   531	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 7–8)
   532	- **Always-on?** Tier 1 — persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks
   533	- **Trigger type:** Webhook (payment received, invoice issued, invoice viewed) + cron sweep at 07:00 daily
   534	- **CortexOS primitives required:** Persistent PTY (#1), Telegram approval surface (#5), standing authorisations (#4)
   535	- **MCP tools required:** Xero / QuickBooks / Sage (one of, per tenant), bank-feed connector
   536	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   537	- **External APIs:** Xero API or QuickBooks API or Sage API; bank feed via Open Banking (TrueLayer / Plaid UK)
   538	- **Gate A:** chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact; never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h
   539	- **Gate B target:** tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline
   540	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — three accounting integrations × Open Banking is the work
   541	- **Gotchas:** Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial. Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic; start with exact-amount matches and expand to fuzzy.

   327	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   328	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   329	- **Payload fields:** `upstream` (e.g. `companies-house`, `web-scraper`, `linkedin-cache`), `endpoint`, `status_code`, `consecutive_failures`
   330	
   331	#### `ESC_SEND_FAIL`
   332	- **Severity:** warn — distinct from auth/rate-limit; the send itself failed at the protocol layer
   333	- **Trigger:** External send (Gmail / Outlook / Twilio / Telegram-to-customer) returned 5xx or transport error after retry budget
   334	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   335	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   336	- **Payload fields:** `channel` (`gmail` | `outlook` | `twilio` | `telegram`), `recipient_id_hash`, `error_class`, `attempts_made`
   337	
   338	### 2.9 — Auto-send orchestration (4 codes)
   339	Source: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 extensions; runtime orchestration semantics
   340	
   341	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING`
   342	- **Severity:** info — distinct from ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW (which is the initial queue event)
   343	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action has been pending operator response for ≥50% of declared `timeout` (heartbeat reminder before bridge timeout)
   344	- **Phase:** `action`
   345	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` (gentle reminder; no oncall)
   346	- **Payload fields:** `original_decision_log_id`, `action_type`, `time_pending_seconds`, `timeout_seconds`, `time_remaining_seconds`
   347	
   348	#### `ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT`
   349	- **Severity:** warn — orange action's approval window expired without response
   350	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action exceeded its `timeout` (default PT4H) without operator approve/reject
   351	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   352	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` (operator absent + commitment may need rerouting)
   353	- **Payload fields:** `original_decision_log_id`, `action_type`, `timeout_seconds`, `target`, `payload_preview`
   354	- **Recovery:** action converts to manual reconciliation; operator handles offline
   355	
   356	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE`
   357	- **Severity:** warn — concurrency / state-change race
   358	- **Trigger:** A send is about to fire when the underlying state has changed in a way that should suppress it. Two canonical use cases:
   359	  - **Duplicate-payload race:** two agents attempted to send the same `payload_hash` within same tenant within `race_window_seconds` (default 60s); second attempt detected by `decision_log` UPSERT-conflict; second wins-suppressed (first sends; idempotency by payload_hash)
   360	  - **State-change race (Cash Conductor):** payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window; the invoice is no longer overdue when the orange-tier approval fires; chase cancelled (do NOT send) per Cash Conductor §4 Step 12
   361	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   362	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   363	- **Payload fields:** `race_class` (`duplicate_payload` | `state_change_cancellation`), `payload_hash`, class-specific: duplicate → `first_agent_name`, `second_agent_name`, `time_delta_ms`, `action_type`; state-change → `entity_id`, `state_before`, `state_after`, `time_delta_ms`
   364	- **Recovery:** duplicate → second suppressed; state-change → cancelled draft logged; no operator action required beyond informational review
   365	
   366	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK`
   367	- **Severity:** info — quality sampling, not a failure
   368	- **Trigger:** Yellow-tier action was sampled per `sample_rate` (1-in-N) for post-hoc human review; sampling is informational + drives ongoing quality monitoring
   369	- **Phase:** `action`
   370	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; sampled action is queued in `spot_check_queue_path` (`/vault/{tenant_slug}/spot-checks/`)
   371	- **Payload fields:** `action_type`, `original_decision_log_id`, `sample_rate`, `sampling_reason`, `target`, `payload_preview`
   372	- **Note:** Operator review of sampled rows is asynchronous (typically end-of-day batch); no SLA timer.
   373	
   374	### 2.10 — Agent workflow (10 codes)
   375	Source: v1.0 agent.md draft specs across Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Cash Conductor, Concierge
   376	
   377	#### `ESC_GATE_B_MISS`
   378	- **Severity:** warn — post-send quality signal; not a hard failure
   379	- **Trigger:** Agent's local Gate B metric thresholds missed for the per-agent window (e.g. Janitor dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%; Diagnostic <30% discovery-call conversion rate; etc — see each agent.md §5)
   380	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   381	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   382	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `metric_name`, `actual_value`, `threshold`, `window`, `sample_size`
   383	- **Note:** Local Gate B is a leading metric for agent quality; consecutive misses inform per-agent quality review. Not tied to a kill-criterion trigger in v1.0 (per disagreement-doc Cat-3 disposition).
   384	
   385	#### `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION`
   386	- **Severity:** warn — voice/tone classifier flagged output as violating a tenant `tone_rule` row
   387	- **Trigger:** Output drafted by an agent matches a tenant-defined `tone_rule` violation pattern (e.g. tenant prohibits "absolutely" in customer-facing comms; output contained it)
   388	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   389	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   390	- **Payload fields:** `tone_rule_id`, `pattern_violated`, `output_snippet_redacted`, `agent_name`, `tenant_slug`
   391	- **Recovery:** agent re-drafts with violation removed; if persistent, escalates to tone_rule review
   392	
   393	#### `ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE`
   394	- **Severity:** warn
   395	- **Trigger:** Field extraction (Janitor backfill / Scribe call-summary / Sourcing CV-parse) returned confidence below per-field threshold (default 0.7); writing the field would risk bad data
   396	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   397	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   398	- **Payload fields:** `entity_type`, `field_name`, `extracted_value`, `confidence_score`, `source` (e.g. `companies-house`, `linkedin`, `cv-pdf`), `agent_name`
   399	
   400	#### `ESC_CANDIDATE_DATA_INCOMPLETE`
   401	- **Severity:** warn
   402	- **Trigger:** Sourcing Scout candidate record lacks ≥N required fields for a shortlist (e.g. no email AND no phone, OR no LinkedIn AND no CV)
   403	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   404	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   405	- **Payload fields:** `candidate_id`, `missing_fields` (list), `shortlist_id`, `brief_id`
   406	
   407	#### `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH`
   408	- **Severity:** **blocking** — outbound send refused (whichever agent firing)
   409	- **Trigger:** Outbound recipient resolution failed — addressee does not match the entity whose lifecycle/event triggered the send. Two canonical use cases:
   410	  - **Cash Conductor:** chase/reminder/invoice addressee does not match Bullhorn placement client OR Xero contact (cross-system reconciliation failure between accounting + ATS)
   411	  - **Concierge:** lifecycle-event email recipient does not match the candidate_id whose state is changing (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim "no candidates emailed under another's name")
   412	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   413	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   414	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `mismatch_class` (one of `cash_conductor_xero_bullhorn` | `concierge_candidate_email` | future variant), plus class-specific fields: Cash Conductor → `bullhorn_client_id`, `xero_contact_id`, `xero_contact_name`, `bullhorn_client_name`, `invoice_id`, `mismatch_dimension` (e.g. `name`, `email`, `address`); Concierge → `expected_candidate_bullhorn_id`, `actual_recipient_email`, `event_type`
   415	- **Recovery:** operator reviews; either reconciles manually OR updates one system to match
   416	
   417	#### `ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS`
   418	- **Severity:** warn — Cash Conductor cannot confidently match incoming payment to a specific invoice
   419	- **Trigger:** Bank-feed payment line cannot be matched to a single Xero invoice; multiple candidates within tolerance
   420	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   421	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   422	- **Payload fields:** `payment_id`, `amount`, `payee_name_raw`, `candidate_invoice_ids` (list), `match_basis` (e.g. `amount_only`, `payee_partial`)
   423	
   424	#### `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT`
   425	- **Severity:** **blocking** — outbound (email / SMS / call) refused
   426	- **Trigger:** Outbound recipient matches tenant's Do-Not-Contact list (loaded from tenant_adapters config); attempted send refused before transport
   427	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   428	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   429	- **Payload fields:** `recipient_id_hash`, `dnc_list_source`, `dnc_match_reason` (e.g. `explicit_opt_out`, `previous_complaint`, `gdpr_objection`), `action_type_attempted`

     3	**Status:** Proposed (Day-18 pre-W7-8-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7 build slice).
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-24.
     5	**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
     6	**Build wave:** v1.0 W7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 598 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A4 line 531 (both say W7-8; consistent).
     7	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540.
     8	**Tier:** Tier 1 (persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks + cron sweep) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 532.

    13	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    14	
    15	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    16	
    17	> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 strategic-value rationale; Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are yellow-tier `xero_reminder_draft_internal` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 182-187 — internal draft sampled for spot-check); the customer-facing send routed via Concierge is orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 257-262; consultant approval required before send). Reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).

    68	## §3 — Output shape
    69	
    70	Three outputs. All load-bearing.
    71	
    72	### Output 1 — Reconciliation rows (yellow tier)
    73	
    74	Per webhook event, Cash Conductor reconciles incoming bank deposits against the tenant's open invoice register. Match algorithm:
    75	
    76	| Stage | Match dimensions | Confidence |
    77	|---|---|---|
    78	| 1 | Exact amount + matching invoice reference in transaction memo | 0.98 |
    79	| 2 | Exact amount + matching payee name | 0.85 |
    80	| 3 | Exact amount + within-90-day-of-invoice-issue window | 0.70 |
    81	| 4 | Fuzzy amount (±0.5% rounding) + matching payee name | 0.65 |
    82	| 5 | Unmatched (queued for review) | <0.50 |
    83	
    84	Stages 1-2 auto-write reconciliation to accounting system (yellow tier; spot-check sampled). Stages 3-4 queue for consultant review. Stage 5 flagged in weekly report.
    85	
    86	Each reconciliation write: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='accounting_reconciliation_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes match confidence + match dimensions.
    87	
    88	### Output 2 — Payment-chase drafts (orange tier)
    89	
    90	For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. Output is a queued draft, NOT a send. Drafts route to Concierge (which handles the actual send pipeline + consultant approval per autosend §4 orange tier).
    91	
    92	Chase draft structure:
    93	
    94	```yaml
    95	draft_id: <uuid>
    96	invoice_id: <accounting-system-invoice-id>
    97	contact_email: <client-billing-contact-email>
    98	subject: "Friendly reminder — invoice <number> from <YYYY-MM-DD>"
    99	body_markdown: <voice-classified consultant-tone reminder>
   100	amount_due: <decimal>
   101	days_overdue: <int>
   102	prior_chases_sent: <int>
   103	escalation_ladder_position: 1-4 per §3.2 below
   104	expected_send_window: orange-tier approval expected within 24h
   105	```
   106	
   107	Each draft: `decision_log` row `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_draft_internal'` (registered yellow tier — but Cash Conductor escalates to orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` for the actual customer-facing send routed via Concierge; this row is the draft itself, not the send), payload includes the draft.
   108	
   109	### §3.2 — Chase escalation ladder
   110	
   111	| Position | Trigger | Tone | Voice classifier minimum |
   112	|---|---|---|---|
   113	| 1 | 7 days overdue | "Friendly reminder, hope everything's OK on your end" | ≥0.75 |
   114	| 2 | 14 days overdue, position-1 sent | "Following up — please let us know if there's a query" | ≥0.75 |
   115	| 3 | 21 days overdue, position-2 sent | "Need to flag this; can we schedule a quick call?" | ≥0.80 (higher bar) |
   116	| 4 | 30 days overdue, position-3 sent | "Escalation to operator review" — drafts STOP; operator manual handle | n/a (not sent) |
   117	
   118	Position 4 is the kill-switch: Cash Conductor never auto-drafts beyond position 3. Operator decides next step manually.
   119

   135	## §4 — Workflow
   136	
   137	14 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
   138	
   139	```
   140	0. Session start (webhook OR cron OR manual)
   141	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + accounting-provider auth +
   142	     Open Banking auth + voice corpus + tone rules
   143	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "<webhook|cron|manual>")
   144	
   145	1. Provider auth refresh
   146	   → accounting: Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh per provider
   147	   → Open Banking: TrueLayer/Plaid UK 90-day token refresh (CRITICAL —
   148	     gotcha per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541); staged ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING:
   149	     ≤30d info, ≤14d warn, ≤7d blocking (operator must re-authorise)
   150	   → ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH or ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH on auth failure
   151	   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
   152	     "accounting:<ok|fail>; open_banking:<ok|fail>; token_aging_stage:<info|warn|blocking|fresh>")
   153	
   154	2. Event router (mode-dependent)
   155	   → if mode=webhook: parse event_type → routes to Step 3-7 path
   156	   → if mode=daily-sweep: routes to Step 4 (invoice ingest) → Step 5 (reconciliation) → Step 7 (chase generation pass) catch-up sequence; sweeps run the full reconciliation-first-then-chase pipeline
   157	   → if mode=weekly-report: skip to Step 13
   158	
   159	3. Bank transaction ingest (mode=webhook from Open Banking)
   160	   → fetch latest transactions since last_ingested_at
   161	   → normalise schema (TrueLayer vs Plaid have different formats)
   162	   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_transactions` (RLS-isolated per
   163	     tenant per Day-4 §6.3 + tenancy-invariants T1-T3; W7 build slice creates
   164	     the table per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres,
   165	     not vault markdown)
   166	   → hh_decision_output("transactions_ingested", "tenant:<slug>",
   167	     "<N> rows since <last_ingested_at>")
   168	
   169	4. Invoice register ingest (mode=webhook from accounting OR daily-sweep)
   170	   → accounting.list_open_invoices() per provider
   171	   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_invoices` (RLS-isolated;
   172	     W7 build slice creates per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
   173	   → hh_decision_output("invoices_ingested", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> rows")
   174	
   175	5. Reconciliation pass (5-stage match algorithm per §3 Output 1)
   176	   → for each transaction × open invoice: compute match confidence
   177	   → write Stage 1-2 matches to accounting (yellow tier) atomically
   178	   → queue Stage 3-4 matches for consultant review (ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS
   179	     per stage)
   180	   → flag Stage 5 (unmatched) in weekly-report exception list
   181	   → hh_decision_output("reconciliation_pass", "tenant:<slug>",
   182	     "stage1_2:<N>; stage3_4:<N>; stage5:<N>")
   183	
   184	6. Reconciliation write (yellow tier; per match)
   185	   → accounting.write_payment_received(invoice_id, payment_id, amount, date)
   186	   → atomic transaction; rollback on 4xx/5xx
   187	   → on success: hh_decision_action("accounting_reconciliation_write",
   188	     "invoice:<id>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   189	   → on failure: ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL
   190	   → spot-check sampling per autosend-safety-policy.yaml yellow tier
   191	
   192	7. Chase generation pass (for overdue, unmatched invoices)
   193	   → query open invoices with age >7 days AND no Stage-1/2 reconciliation
   194	   → for each, determine chase position 1-4 based on age + prior chases
   195	     sent (read from `cash_conductor_invoices.last_chase_position` — v0.3
   196	     schema-backed field per migration §3; NOT from decision_log payload)
   197	   → if position=4: STOP — operator review (no auto-draft)
   198	   → else: proceed to Step 8
   199	
   200	8. LLM chase-draft generation (per overdue invoice)
   201	   → prompt = (invoice details + client context + position-N tone +
   202	     voice corpus + tone rules)
   203	   → output = email body + subject
   204	   → voice classifier scores against tenant style (≥0.75 for position 1-2;
   205	     ≥0.80 for position 3 per §3.2)
   206	   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <threshold after 3 retries
   207	   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_generated", "invoice:<id>",
   208	     "position:<N>; voice_score:<N>; words:<N>")
   209	
   210	9. Chase-draft validation (Gate A specifics)
   211	   → verify: invoice_number cited matches invoice_id
   212	   → verify: amount_due cited matches accounting record
   213	   → verify: client_contact_email matches active billing contact
   214	   → verify: NOT paid in last 24h (re-query accounting)
   215	   → ESC code mapping by failure class:
   216	     - invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition mismatch →
   217	       `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint failure)
   218	     - client_contact_email / addressee mismatch (chase routed to wrong
   219	       customer) → `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (per catalogue §2.10 — explicitly
   220	       blocking for Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee resolution)
   221	     `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` is reserved for red-tier action attempts per
   222	     catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's chase pipeline is orange-tier.
   223	   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_validated", invoice_id, "passed")
   224	
   225	10. Chase-draft queue to Concierge (orange tier)
   226	    → POST internal API → Concierge agent receives draft
   227	    → Concierge handles autosend-bridge call to operator (D1 path per
   228	      Founder Decision)
   229	    → hh_decision_action("xero_reminder_draft_internal", "invoice:<id>",
   230	      payload_hash, payload_preview); tier=yellow internal-draft; the
   231	      customer-facing send (orange tier) happens in Concierge as
   232	      `xero_reminder_send_customer` after operator approval
   233	
   234	11. (Operator approves via Concierge → Concierge sends → Cash Conductor
   235	    records send event)
   236	    → Concierge fires webhook back: chase_sent
   237	    → Cash Conductor updates internal state: prior_chases_sent counter
   238	
   239	12. (Mode=webhook only) Re-trigger eligibility check
   240	    → was this webhook also a "payment received" that just hit?
   241	    → re-run Step 5 to check if any chases-in-flight should be cancelled
   242	      (paid-since-draft-but-before-send race condition)
   243	    → if so: ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE → cancel chase draft (do NOT send)
   244	    → hh_decision_output("chase_cancellation_check", "invoice:<id>",
   245	      "cancelled:<bool>")
   246	
   247	13. Weekly report assembly (mode=weekly-report; runs Monday 06:00 UTC)
   248	    → query decision_log + accounting + bank feed for the 7-day window
   249	    → compute DSO metric (Gate B tracking)
   250	    → 6-section Markdown report per §3 Output 3
   251	    → write to /vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md
   252	    → hh_decision_output("weekly_report", report_path,
   253	      "dso_delta_days:<N>; sections:6")
   254	
   255	14. Session close

   263	
   264	## §5 — Gates
   265	
   266	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   267	
   268	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Cash Conductor's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim):
   269	
   270	- **"chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact"** (all three; AND not OR)
   271	- **"never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h"** (defence-in-depth re-query at draft time)
   272	- Voice classifier score ≥0.75 for position 1-2 chases; ≥0.80 for position 3
   273	- No PII outside firm boundary in chase body
   274	- Reconciliation match confidence ≥0.85 for auto-write (Stage 1-2 only)
   275	- Open Banking token >30 days from expiry (otherwise warn)
   276	- Accounting auth refresh succeeded in Step 1
   277	
   278	Gate A failures fire either `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (invoice/amount/paid-precondition miss; output-shape constraint) OR `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (client_contact_email mismatch; blocking per catalogue §2.10 — explicit Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee case). Draft stays in `/tmp` (auto-purged 24h); operator notified per the specific ESC route.
   279	
   280	**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Cash Conductor `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W7 build slice. The W7 build delivers `agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
   281	
   282	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (FD-tier closer metric)
   283	
   284	Per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim: **"tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline"**.
   285	
   286	DSO = Days Sales Outstanding = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days.
   287	
   288	Measured monthly via the weekly report's §2 trend. Month-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (before Cash Conductor active). Month-3 target = month-0 minus 12 days.
   289	
   290	This is THE FD-tier closer metric per master brief §8.2 line 598 ("DSO drops by 15 days"; ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 sets the 12-day Gate B target — note minor drift from the master brief's 15-day pitch which is the more aggressive marketing position) — a local leading metric for Cash Conductor quality. Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Cash Conductor's DSO improvement is NOT directly mapped to a v1.0 kill-criterion trigger; it's tracked as a local Gate B signal. Below ≥12 days improvement for 2 consecutive months → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → founder + operator review (likely indicates heuristic tuning, escalation-ladder timing, OR tenant-specific late-payment patterns we haven't modelled).
   291	
   292	---
   293	
   294	## §6 — Escalation codes
   295	
   296	Cash Conductor uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
   297	
   298	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   299	|---|---|---|---|
   300	| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH` | Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   301	| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL` | Accounting 4xx/5xx on reconciliation write | warn | operator_chat_id |
   302	| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH` | TrueLayer/Plaid UK auth fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   303	| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING` | Open Banking PSD2 consent approaching 90-day expiry (staged) | info ≤30d / warn ≤14d / **blocking** ≤7d (per catalogue §2.7) | operator_chat_id (info+warn); + ifos_oncall_chat_id at blocking stage |
   304	| `ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS` | Stage 3-4 match queued for review | warn (per catalogue §2.10) | operator_chat_id |
   305	| `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE` | Payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window | warn | operator_chat_id |
   306	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Chase voice classifier below threshold after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
   307	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in chase body | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   308	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A miss on invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition (NOT addressee mismatch — that uses ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   309	| `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` | Gate A miss on client_contact_email / addressee resolution (per catalogue §2.10 Cash Conductor case) | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   310	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | DSO improvement below 12-day target for 2 consecutive months | warn | founder + operator |
   311	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Accounting OR Open Banking 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
   312	| `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING` | Chase draft awaiting consultant approval — heartbeat at ≥50% of declared timeout (per catalogue §2.9 trigger) | info | operator_chat_id (gentle reminder; no oncall CC) |
   313	
   314	Cash Conductor does NOT use:
   315	
   316	- Bullhorn-specific codes (no Bullhorn dependency)
   317	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's red-tier per catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's pipeline is orange-tier (chase send) or yellow-tier (reconciliation write); Gate A misses fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead
   318	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Cash Conductor's Gate A misses are output-shape failures, not schema-field violations
   319	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Cash Conductor fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
   320	
   321	---
   322	
   323	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   324	
   325	Step 8 (chase-draft generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   326	
   327	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `cash_conductor`** — surfaces rules like:
   328	  - No "Final demand" or legal-threatening language (escalation ladder caps at position 3; position 4 is operator-handled)
   329	  - No reference to the client's industry / sector pain points (chase is operational, not strategic)
   330	  - No mentions of late-payment fees unless tenant's terms explicitly state them
   331	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "professional polite chase email" task context.
   332	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `cash_conductor` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the chase voice classifier score is below threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Cash Conductor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Cash Conductor.
   333	
   334	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
   335	
   336	---
   337	
   338	## §8 — Build dependencies (W7-8 prerequisites)
   339	
   340	Cash Conductor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:
   341	
   342	| Dependency | Source | Status |
   343	|---|---|---|
   344	| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
   345	| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ |
   346	| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
   347	| **Tenant's accounting choice confirmed** (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
   348	| **Accounting commercial signup** (developer access + sandbox) | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
   349	| **Open Banking commercial signup** (TrueLayer or Plaid UK) | Founder commercial; ~£100-300/mo | ⏸ |
   350	| Xero MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   351	| QuickBooks MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   352	| Sage MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days; may defer if no pilot uses Sage v1.0) | ⏸ |
   353	| Open Banking MCP connector | W7 build start (~3 days; harder due to 90-day token rotation) | ⏸ |
   354	| Per-tenant accounting credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
   355	| Per-tenant Open Banking credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
   356	| Concierge agent.md ratified Accepted (for chase-send routing contract; full Concierge production-build at W10-13, but Cash Conductor only depends on the Concierge agent.md contract being Accepted, not the full bundle being In Force) | Post-Concierge agent.md re-ratification | ⏸ |
   357	| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
   358	| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W7 start (~1 day; complex due to 4 validators) | ⏸ |
   359	| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W7 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
   360	| `cycle.sh` orchestration (14-step) | Build at W7 start (~3 days; most complex of v1.0 agents) | ⏸ |
   361	| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W7 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
   362	
   363	**ADR-005 framing:** ADR-005 (Week-3 Diagnostic acceleration) notes Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips because it has zero Bullhorn dependency. v0.3 supplement: Cash Conductor pull-forward (from W7-8 to W4-5) is NOT explicitly authorised by ADR-005 §5.1 (that section number doesn't exist; earlier draft mis-cited). Pull-forward would require a separate ADR (e.g. ADR-007 if/when needed); accounting + Open Banking commercial signups remain founder-action gates regardless of timing.
   364	
   365	---
   366	
   367	## §9 — Status + open questions
   368	
   369	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7-8 build slice start.
   370	
   371	### Open questions for founder review
   372	
   373	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   374	|---|---|---|
   375	| Q1 | First-tenant accounting choice — Xero / QuickBooks / Sage? Affects which connector is W7-prio-1. | Tenant onboarding; depends on first pilot tenant's existing stack. |
   376	| Q2 | Open Banking provider — TrueLayer or Plaid UK? Both have UK coverage; TrueLayer slightly cheaper at low volume; Plaid has broader US-EU coverage for v1.1+ expansion. | Founder commercial. Recommend TrueLayer for v1.0 UK-only pilots. |
   377	| Q3 | Open Banking 90-day token rotation UX — when token nears expiry, operator must re-authenticate via tenant's bank login. How is this triggered? Telegram nudge? Brain UI dashboard? | Recommend: ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING fires Telegram nudge at 30/14/7 days; tenant-admin handles via Brain UI v1.1. |
   378	| Q4 | Chase escalation ladder — 4 positions proposed in §3.2. Founder confidence each position's timing + tone is right? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant's payment terms (net-30 vs net-14 vs net-60). |
   379	| Q5 | Reconciliation Stage 3-4 (fuzzy / ambiguous matches) — consultant review queue UX. Brain UI workflow? Telegram? | v1.0: weekly report exception list. v1.1: Brain UI per-row review queue. |
   380	| Q6 | DSO baseline establishment — month-0 baseline measured pre-deployment. How do we measure if accounting system data is incomplete or fragmented? | First pilot tenant: 30-day baseline measurement period BEFORE Cash Conductor goes live; documented in pilot LOI. |
   381	| Q7 | Hire #1 anchor — what specific Cash Conductor sub-tasks does Hire #1 take vs Claude Code? | Founder strategic decision; recommend Hire #1 owns Open Banking connector + ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING UX. Cash Conductor agent.md + cycle.sh stays with founder + Claude Code for consistency with other agents. |
   382	| Q8 | Sage connector — defer if no v1.0 pilot uses Sage? Saves ~2 days. Risk: blocks future Sage-using pilots. | Recommend defer to v1.1; document in W7 build start review. |
   383	
   384	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541)
   385	
   386	1. **Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial.** Plan for the rotation UX up-front; ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING staged at 30/14/7 days from expiry; document tenant-admin re-auth procedure.
   387	2. **Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic.** Start with exact-amount matches (Stage 1-2); expand to fuzzy (Stage 3-4) as confidence builds.
   388	3. **5 stages of match algorithm** is intentionally conservative for v1.0 to avoid false-positive reconciliation writes (which corrupt the tenant's accounting books).
   389	4. **Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "verify, don't assume." If Hire #1 doesn't start on time, Cash Conductor build runs founder-solo and may slip.
   390

   392	
   393	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   394	
   395	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.
   396	
   397	Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
   398	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   399	- Founder approves §9 Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q7 + Q8
   400	- Q3 UX flow approved (operator re-auth path)
   401	
   402	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   403	- W7-8 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   404	- First production webhook processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
   405	- 30-day month-0 baseline measured for first pilot
   406	- Hire #1 onboarded + integrated into the build workstream (per master brief §8.2 line 604)
   407	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill
   408	
   409	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

     1	# IFOS escalation codes catalogue
     2	
     3	**Status:** Reference — single source of truth for `ESC_*` codes used by any agent. Wired into `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (Phase 3).
     4	**Mandated by:** master brief §8.1 Change 3 — "Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one."
     5	**Update protocol:** new codes added here BEFORE wiring into helpers + before referencing from any agent bundle. Code names are case-sensitive; pattern `ESC_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`.
     6	
     7	---
     8	
     9	## §1 — How escalation codes work
    10	
    11	Every `ESC_*` is a payload written to Postgres `decision_log` (per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + Day-4 §6.3 schema) plus a Telegram notification to the operator (per master brief §2.4 primitive 5 + `common-notifications.json` routing).
    12	
    13	The payload template established by `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4 + ratified in `autosend-safety-policy.md` §5:
    14	
    15	```
    16	agent_name        — the agent firing the escalation (or '_renderer')
    17	tenant_slug       — RLS-isolated per tenant
    18	phase             — one of {trigger, output, action, gating_failed, agent_handoff}; per decision_log CHECK constraint at Day-4 §6.3
    19	human_action      — the ESC_* code itself + optional `:reason` suffix
    20	payload           — JSON object: {tier?, action_type?, target?, payload_hash?, reason, ...code-specific fields}
    21	created_at        — `now()` at insertion
    22	```
    23	
    24	The Telegram message is templated via `common-notifications.json` `escalation_routes.<ESC_CODE>` if present; otherwise routed to `operator_chat_id`. `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED` additionally CCs `ifos_oncall_chat_id`.

    32	
    33	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`
    34	- **Severity:** info → blocking-pending-approval
    35	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action queued for tenant operator review
    36	- **Phase:** `action`
    37	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` via Telegram approval gate (primitive 4)
    38	- **Timeout:** 4h default per `common-notifications.json.default_approval_timeout_seconds`; on timeout, converts to manual reconciliation
    39	- **Payload fields:** `tier`, `action_type`, `target`, `payload_hash`, `payload_preview`, `approval_status='pending'`
    40	
    41	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`
    42	- **Severity:** warn (informational; no human action needed)
    43	- **Trigger:** Red-tier action attempted; refused entirely (red is the tier-override floor per autosend §8)
    44	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    45	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; informational only
    46	- **Payload fields:** `tier='red'`, `action_type`, `target`, `payload_hash`, `reason='red_tier_classification'`
    47	
    48	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`
    49	- **Severity:** **critical** — operational failure, not a policy decision
    50	- **Trigger:** `autosend_policy_lookup()` could not resolve a tier for the given `action_type` (unknown action_type, malformed `autosend-policy.yaml`, or tenant override resolution failed)
    51	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    52	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` — IFOS oncall must investigate
    53	- **Payload fields:** `tier='fail-safe-red'`, `action_type`, `target`, `reason` (one of `unknown_action_type`, `override_resolution_failed`, `unknown_tier:<value>`)
    54	- **Fail-safe behaviour:** Action refused regardless of declared tier

    57	Source: `docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` §6
    58	
    59	#### `ESC_VAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT`

    62	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    63	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    64	- **Payload fields:** `vault_path`, `lock_holder_pid` (if knowable), `wait_duration_ms`
    65	
    66	#### `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`
    67	- **Severity:** warn
    68	- **Trigger:** Postgres optimistic-concurrency UPDATE found 0 rows after `OP_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS = 100` retry (per `common-vault.json.retry_backoff_ms`); per vault-concurrency §3 retry policy
    69	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    70	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    71	- **Payload fields:** `entity_id`, `expected_version`, `actual_version`
    72	
    73	#### `ESC_VAULT_HUMAN_EDIT_BLOCKED`
    74	- **Severity:** warn — likely founder is editing in Obsidian
    75	- **Trigger:** Obsidian debounce hit `MAX_RETRIES = 5` (file mtime still recent after 30s of waiting) per vault-concurrency §4 + `common-vault.json.obsidian_debounce_max_retries`
    76	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`

    78	- **Payload fields:** `vault_path`, `file_mtime`, `last_observed_age_ms`
    79	
    80	#### `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_PARTIAL_FAILURE`
    81	- **Severity:** warn — requires founder manual reconciliation
    82	- **Trigger:** Rewrite-backlinks cascade completed but ≥1 referencing entity failed to rewrite per vault-concurrency §5.4 v1.0 mitigation
    83	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    84	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    85	- **Payload fields:** `failures` (list of entity_id strings), `successful_count`, `total_count`
    86	
    87	#### `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_TIMEOUT`
    88	- **Severity:** warn
    89	- **Trigger:** Cascade exceeded `CASCADE_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` ms per vault-concurrency §5 + `common-vault.json.cascade_timeout_ms`
    90	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    91	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`

    95	Source: `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 + §6
    96	
    97	#### `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH`
    98	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent enters degraded mode (drafts-only, no auto-send)
    99	- **Trigger:** Bullhorn OAuth token refresh failed twice on the per-agent 8-minute cycle (per `common-ats.json.auth_refresh_interval_seconds`); or REST call returned 401 indefinitely (revoked token in Bullhorn admin UI)
   100	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   101	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   102	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type` (one of `refresh_failed`, `revoked_401`), `last_attempt_at`, `consecutive_failures`
   103	- **Recovery:** agent stays in degraded mode until founder rotates token via Bullhorn admin → next `_secrets.env` reload picks up new token

   106	Source: `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4
   107	
   108	#### `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED`
   109	- **Severity:** blocking — render did not produce a runnable agent dir
   110	- **Trigger:** Renderer exited non-zero. Mid-render atomic-rename per ADR-003 §3.3.4 means the prior agent dir at target is preserved (`.prev.<timestamp>/`) — no half-rendered state visible to daemon discovery
   111	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   112	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; CC `ifos_oncall_chat_id` only on `atomic-rename-failed` (infrastructure failure, not author error)
   113	- **Agent name:** `_renderer` (sentinel; not a real agent)
   114	- **Payload fields:** `reason` (one of `schema-validation-failure`, `bundle-malformed`, `shared-helpers-missing`, `tenant-not-provisioned`, `atomic-rename-failed`, `non-rendered-target`), `agent_name_attempted`, `tenant_slug_attempted`

   137	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   138	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   139	- **Status:** v1.0 placeholder; no agent fires this yet. Reserved name.
   140	
   141	#### `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY`
   142	- **Severity:** warn — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   143	- **Trigger:** Brief Decoder (Sourcing Scout subskill at master brief §8.2 row 5; full agent in v1.1+) cannot resolve brief requirements to confident shortlist criteria
   144	- **Phase:** `agent_handoff`
   145	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   146	- **Payload fields:** `brief_id`, `ambiguity_dimensions` (list of {`field`, `confidence`}), `proposed_clarifying_questions`
   147	
   148	#### `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK`
   149	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent halts immediately, no retry
   150	- **Trigger:** Agent output references PII outside the firm boundary (cross-tenant PII detected by `validate.sh` Gate A or RLS check)

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 strategic-value rationale; Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are yellow-tier `xero_reminder_draft_internal` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 182-187 — internal draft sampled for spot-check); the customer-facing send routed via Concierge is orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 257-262; consultant approval required before send). Reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:86:Each reconciliation write: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='accounting_reconciliation_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes match confidence + match dimensions.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:107:Each draft: `decision_log` row `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_draft_internal'` (registered yellow tier — but Cash Conductor escalates to orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` for the actual customer-facing send routed via Concierge; this row is the draft itself, not the send), payload includes the draft.

1. §4 Step 11 updates structured state without a `hh_decision_*` call. Lines 234-237 say Cash Conductor records `chase_sent` and updates `prior_chases_sent`, but there is no decision-log write. Type-specific §4 requires `hh_decision_*` at every step that produces output or takes action. Add a registered status/action row such as `hh_decision_action("cash_conductor_chase_sent_recorded", ...)` or equivalent.

2. §4 Step 7 creates an operator-review outcome without logging it. Lines 192-198 say position 4 stops auto-drafting and sends the invoice to operator review, but no `hh_decision_output` or escalation row records that outcome. Add an explicit decision-log output/action for the position-4 operator-review case.

3. Gate A’s Open Banking token rule is internally inconsistent. Line 275 lists “Open Banking token >30 days from expiry (otherwise warn)” under “Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action),” while lines 147-152 and 303 define staged behaviour as ≤30d info, ≤14d warn, ≤7d blocking. Make only the ≤7d blocking condition a Gate A hard-fail, and move the 30/14-day states to health warnings.

4. The §4 citation overstates the master brief. Line 137 claims master brief §8.1 Change 2 requires every output/action step to call `hh_decision_*`; the cited master brief section only requires three calls per agent run (`trigger`, `output`, `action`). Keep the stronger requirement, but cite the agent-bundle ratification rule or ADR-003 bundle pattern instead of attributing it solely to the master brief.
