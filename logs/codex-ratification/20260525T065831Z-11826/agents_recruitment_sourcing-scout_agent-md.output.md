=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing

**Status:** Proposed.
**Build state:** Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fix applied. R9 added §10 three-state lifecycle clarification (Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted → In Force; ratification ≠ acceptance per agent-bundle skill) + §4 Step 8 + Schema-key block rewrite for `blocked_recipients`. R19 (today): adds `blocked_recipients` declaration to v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions per Codex Finding 1. Awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice.

**Schema-key references:**
- `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — registered in `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (line 397); canonical Postgres-backed v1.0 DNC source per ADR-002. YAML schema declaration deferred to future schema-doc audit (covers all pre-v0.3 allowlist keys not yet declared in YAML).
- `tenant_adapters.config.auto_source_on_brief_create` — v0.4-supplement-pending (not yet in any allowlist); the Bullhorn-webhook auto-source trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 lands.
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button OR Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`). Bullhorn "new brief" webhook auto-source (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547) is DEFERRED to v1.1+ — blocked on `auto_source_on_brief_create` config key landing in a v0.4 supplement. Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Brain UI (v1.0 primary)

Brain UI v1.0 "Source candidates" button on any brief detail page → POST internal API → Sourcing Scout webhook.

### Telegram command (v1.0)

```
@ifos_bot scout <brief-id-or-slug>
@ifos_bot scout --description "Senior React engineer, London, £120k, hybrid"
```

### Webhook (DEFERRED to v1.1+)

Bullhorn "new brief created" webhook → routed via internal bus → Sourcing Scout if tenant config enables `auto_source_on_brief_create`. v0.4-supplement-pending (config key not yet registered); webhook-trigger code path is BLOCKED until v0.4 supplement lands. v1.0 invocation is Brain UI button + Telegram only.

### CLI (v1.0 — debugging)

```bash
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --brief-id <id>
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --description "<free-text>"
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Night Sourcer Tier-1 always-on (Brain UI dashboard; cortextOS primitive #6)
- Bulk-source mode (`--brief-list briefs.csv`)
- Refresh-source mode (re-source against the same brief 30 days later)

---

## §3 — Output shape

One output per invocation. Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`. Structure:

```markdown
# Sourcing Scout — <Brief title>
**Generated:** <ISO-date>  **Brief ID:** <Bullhorn-brief-id>  **Tenant:** <slug>
**Sources searched:** Bullhorn ATS + LinkedIn (Proxycurl) + Reed + CV-Library
**Aggregate candidates:** <N> (top 5-15 ranked)

## Brief context
<2-3 sentences summarising the role from the brief input>

## Ranked candidates

### 1. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.92
**Source:** Bullhorn (passive match) | **Contact:** <method + verified>
**Match rationale:**
<≥50 words explaining why this candidate is a match — references brief
requirements + candidate background; cites Bullhorn placement history,
LinkedIn current role, or other source-specific evidence.>
**Risk flags:** <e.g., "active with placement at competitor agency 2024";
"prefers contract not perm per Bullhorn note">
**Profile links:** [Bullhorn](url) | [LinkedIn](url)

### 2. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.88
...

(5-15 candidates total)

## Source breakdown
| Source | Candidates contributed | Avg confidence | Rate-limit budget remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bullhorn ATS | <N> | <score> | n/a (no quota) |
| LinkedIn (Proxycurl) | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| Reed | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| CV-Library | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |

## Diagnostic + exception list
- <Any source failures (e.g., "Reed API 429; retried once; 3 candidates lost")>
- <Any "do not contact" filter hits>
- <Any low-confidence candidates discarded (below 0.5)>
```

Per `decision_log`: one row per source query + one row per candidate proposed + one final aggregate row.

Voice-classified content: only the per-candidate match rationale (Step 9). Voice classifier ≥0.75 against tenant style. Rationale that fails after 3 retries → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT → candidate dropped from list + flagged in exception list.

---

## §4 — Workflow

11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-
     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
     registered config key)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")

1. Brief ingestion
   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
     "key_dims:<N>")

2. Multi-source auth refresh
   → bullhorn (read-only); LinkedIn/Proxycurl; Reed; CV-Library
   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
       enters degraded mode per catalogue ("drafts-only, no auto-send" —
       Sourcing-Scout-specific interpretation: skip Bullhorn source +
       continue with other 3 sources, since Sourcing Scout has no
       auto-send path of its own; the "drafts-only" framing maps to
       "report-only with Bullhorn data omitted from the sourcing set")
     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (Sourcing Scout: cached LinkedIn search only; live profile fetches
       skipped)
     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
       Reed search results only)
     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (cached CV-Library search only)
   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>")

3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
     modification recency within the active set.
   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

4. LinkedIn search (via Proxycurl)
   → proxycurl.search_people(query=brief_key_dimensions, location=brief_location,
     industry=brief_sector)
   → up to 30 profiles
   → cache 1h per (query, location, sector) tuple
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Proxycurl quota hit (payload.upstream='linkedin')
   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

5. Reed query
   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='reed')
   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

6. CV-Library query
   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

7. Aggregate + dedupe
   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + LinkedIn
     match" if found in both)
   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")

8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients`
     (concept referenced by autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
     `send_to_blocked_recipient` action_type + ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT catalogue
     §2.10; the config key IS registered in the canonical authority
     `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (line 397).
     v0.4-pending status applies ONLY to `auto_source_on_brief_create`
     (the webhook auto-source trigger config), NOT to `blocked_recipients`.
     Postgres-backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — NOT vault markdown.
     Future schema-doc audit will land `blocked_recipients` declaration
     in the YAML schema files alongside other pre-v0.3 allowlist keys.)
   → remove any candidate matching any DNC identifier from the sourcing list
   → log dropped candidates to exception list in §3 output
   → NOTE: ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT is catalogue §2.10 reserved for OUTBOUND SEND
     REFUSAL specifically. Sourcing Scout filters DNC matches AT SOURCING
     TIME (pre-outbound); no outbound send attempt occurs. v0.3 disposition:
     log DNC drops in exception list only; no ESC fire. W4-polish backlog:
     add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER for the pre-outbound case.
   → hh_decision_output("dnc_filter", "brief:<id>",
     "dropped:<N>; kept:<N>")

9. LLM ranking + rationale generation (per candidate)
   → for top 15 by source-aggregated confidence: generate per-candidate
     rationale ≥50 words
   → prompt = (brief context + candidate profile + voice corpus + tone rules)
   → voice classifier scores rationale (≥0.75)
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries; drop candidate
     from final list
   → hh_decision_output("candidate_proposed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id|external_ref>",
     "source:<bullhorn|linkedin|reed|cvlibrary>; confidence:<N>; voice_score:<N>; included:<bool>") — emitted PER CANDIDATE per §3 contract (one row per candidate proposed; dropped candidates also get a row with included=false + drop_reason)

10. Output assembly + Gate A validation
    → ensure 5-15 candidates remaining after Step 9
    → ensure each has working contact method (email validated via simple
      regex + domain MX check; phone validated via E.164 format)
    → ensure each rationale ≥50 words
    → if any condition fails: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE (output-shape violation
      per catalogue line 184 — distinct from ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION which is
      reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time);
      partial draft to /tmp; abort
    → write Markdown report to vault path per §3
    → hh_decision_output("scout_report", report_path, "N candidates from M sources")

11. Session close + notification
    → operator notification per invocation source (Brain UI: in-app
      notification; Telegram: reply with report path; webhook: bus event back)
    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):

- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text → fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (BLOCKING per catalogue §2.5 lines 148-154; halts immediately, not warn-only output-shape)
- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)

Gate A failure routing by class:
- PII leakage → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall)
- Output-shape failures (count not in 5-15, contact-method missing, rationale <50 words, voice classifier miss, all-source-failure-without-degradation) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
Draft to `/tmp`; operator review.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.

Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply (v1.0). Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant. NOTE: Bullhorn-note feedback is NOT a v1.0 path (Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn per §1 + §6 contracts; would require write capability not in v1.0 scope).

Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).

Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | LinkedIn / Proxycurl session/OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / linkedin / reed / cv-library) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |

Sourcing Scout does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §8 — Build dependencies (W9 prerequisites)

Sourcing Scout build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified | Week 3 Codex Round 4 | ⏸ |
| Janitor ratified (Bullhorn-read substrate) | W5 Codex Round | ⏸ |
| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ |
| Bullhorn MCP read capability | W3-W4-W5 build chain | ⏸ |
| **Proxycurl commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial; ~$39+/mo | ⏸ |
| **Reed.co.uk commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
| **CV-Library commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
| Proxycurl MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Reed MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| CV-Library MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Source-abstraction layer (Night Sourcer reuse) | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant source credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Tenant DNC list populated in `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-backed structured state per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W9 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W9 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (11-step) | Build at W9 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W9 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Pre-W9-build prerequisites (must resolve to ✅ before W9 starts):** all items listed up to and including "Tenant DNC list populated", "Voice corpus seeded", and "Per-tenant source credentials in _secrets.env" — these are FOUNDER/TENANT-ADMIN actions that the W9 build cannot deliver itself. The four sibling-bundle items below (validate.sh, context.sh, cycle.sh, fixtures) ARE the W9 build slice itself — those are deliverables not prerequisites. Their completion is the W9-build-end Status-flip criterion (Proposed → Accepted), not the W9-build-start gate.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
| Q2 | Proxycurl pricing — ~$39/mo for 5,000 credits at low volume; scales with usage. Per pilot tenant budget? | ~5-10 briefs/day per consultant × 50 calls/brief = up to 2,500 credits/day per consultant. Cost: ~$20-50/day at peak. |
| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback (Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet) | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful" → `decision_log` row via `consultant_feedback` green-tier action_type. v1.1: Brain UI button. NOTE: Bullhorn-note-based feedback is NOT a v1.0 path — Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn (no write capability); Bullhorn note creation would require tools.yaml write capability + autosend/decision logging which v1.0 explicitly excludes. |
| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)

1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.

---

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built 2026-05-24, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED verdict on the SCAFFOLD shape (output contract + workflow + gates + escalation + dependencies). **Ratification of the scaffold does NOT make it Accepted.** Per the agent-bundle skill, Accepted means production-ready — which requires all sibling bundle files + fixtures + first production run.

**Three-state lifecycle:**

1. **Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold** when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED on this agent.md alone. Pre-build scaffold confirmed shape-correct; the document is a binding contract for the W9 build slice.

2. **Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted** when ALL:
   - W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files (`tools.yaml`, `context.sh`, `validate.sh`, `cycle.sh`, `cleanup.sh`) + 3 fixtures with golden outputs
   - Codex re-ratifies the full bundle (agent.md + siblings + fixtures) post-build
   - Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
   - Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
   - Q6: source-abstraction-layer ADR drafted + ratified (new ADR — not the same as ADR-006 which is Diagnostic Gate A; number assigned at authoring time)

3. **Accepted → In Force** when:
   - First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
   - Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram /scout-feedback path; Brain UI in v1.1)
   - First production render against a pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)

Until W9 build: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/README.md:33:*End of Sourcing Scout README.*
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:1:# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:4:**Build state:** Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fix applied. R9 added §10 three-state lifecycle clarification (Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted → In Force; ratification ≠ acceptance per agent-bundle skill) + §4 Step 8 + Schema-key block rewrite for `blocked_recipients`. R19 (today): adds `blocked_recipients` declaration to v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions per Codex Finding 1. Awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:7:- `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — registered in `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (line 397); canonical Postgres-backed v1.0 DNC source per ADR-002. YAML schema declaration deferred to future schema-doc audit (covers all pre-v0.3 allowlist keys not yet declared in YAML).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:8:- `tenant_adapters.config.auto_source_on_brief_create` — v0.4-supplement-pending (not yet in any allowlist); the Bullhorn-webhook auto-source trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 lands.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:11:**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:12:**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:13:**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:21:> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button OR Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`). Bullhorn "new brief" webhook auto-source (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547) is DEFERRED to v1.1+ — blocked on `auto_source_on_brief_create` config key landing in a v0.4 supplement. Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:267:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:271:Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:273:Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply (v1.0). Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant. NOTE: Bullhorn-note feedback is NOT a v1.0 path (Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn per §1 + §6 contracts; would require write capability not in v1.0 scope).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:275:Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:277:Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:349:| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W9 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:351:**Pre-W9-build prerequisites (must resolve to ✅ before W9 starts):** all items listed up to and including "Tenant DNC list populated", "Voice corpus seeded", and "Per-tenant source credentials in _secrets.env" — these are FOUNDER/TENANT-ADMIN actions that the W9 build cannot deliver itself. The four sibling-bundle items below (validate.sh, context.sh, cycle.sh, fixtures) ARE the W9 build slice itself — those are deliverables not prerequisites. Their completion is the W9-build-end Status-flip criterion (Proposed → Accepted), not the W9-build-start gate.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:357:**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:365:| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:366:| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:367:| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback (Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet) | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful" → `decision_log` row via `consultant_feedback` green-tier action_type. v1.1: Brain UI button. NOTE: Bullhorn-note-based feedback is NOT a v1.0 path — Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn (no write capability); Bullhorn note creation would require tools.yaml write capability + autosend/decision logging which v1.0 explicitly excludes. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:368:| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:369:| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:371:### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:374:2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:385:1. **Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold** when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED on this agent.md alone. Pre-build scaffold confirmed shape-correct; the document is a binding contract for the W9 build slice.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:388:   - W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files (`tools.yaml`, `context.sh`, `validate.sh`, `cycle.sh`, `cleanup.sh`) + 3 fixtures with golden outputs

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS. Every tenant runs the same agent fleet (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge in v1.0) against their own data, isolated from every other tenant's data. **A single cross-tenant data leak is a catastrophic failure mode** — it breaches the GDPR contract, violates pilot LOI terms, and burns customer trust.

Implemented at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` via regex check per section heading. Hard-fail on miss → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`. **The per-section citation subcheck has no warn-only paths** (full implementation; hard-fail at v0). This satisfies Rule 4 (Quality gates before features) for the per-section subcheck — Gate A's section-citation requirement is unambiguously hard-fail; the upstream ULTRAPLAN clause "no claims unsupported by source data" is interpreted at Gate A as "every section has at least one evidence link", consistent with the implementation.
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:114:- Other agents (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge) Gate A framings can follow the same per-agent ADR pattern (numbers assigned at authoring time, not pre-reserved here) if needed for their own Cat-ζ findings — though most other agents' Gate A is implementation-realistic at v0, so this may not be needed

docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:182:1. **No `chokidar` watcher in the bus.** The bus is poll-based, not push-based. `grep -rn chokidar src/` returns zero hits; `chokidar@^5.0.0` in `package.json:47` is used only by `dashboard/src/lib/watcher.ts:5` for the dashboard UI's file change feed, not for inter-agent message delivery. Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.

docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:185:W9:   Sourcing Scout (A5)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:72:- **The file bus.** Inter-agent handoff via shared filesystem directories. No queue, no API, no serialisation tax. Brief Decoder writes a parsed-brief file; Sourcing Scout's `FastChecker` polls it up at the configured cadence (default 1000ms `pollInterval`, configurable per agent); result lands in a sub-directory the Concierge is polling. Four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound.

The first pass shows the referenced helper functions and most escalation codes exist, but I need exact line checks because the ratification brief treats citation drift as load-bearing. I’m narrowing now to the authoritative source snippets around the claimed anchors.

   535	- **MCP tools required:** Xero / QuickBooks / Sage (one of, per tenant), bank-feed connector
   536	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   537	- **External APIs:** Xero API or QuickBooks API or Sage API; bank feed via Open Banking (TrueLayer / Plaid UK)
   538	- **Gate A:** chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact; never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h
   539	- **Gate B target:** tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline
   540	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — three accounting integrations × Open Banking is the work
   541	- **Gotchas:** Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial. Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic; start with exact-amount matches and expand to fuzzy.

   543	#### A5. Sourcing Scout (daytime form) — request-response sourcing
   544	
   545	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 8–9)
   546	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — request-response
   547	- **Trigger type:** Brain UI button, Telegram command, or webhook from a "new brief" event
   548	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None for the daytime form (Night Sourcer in v1.1 will use #6)
   549	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read for ATS passive matches), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), Reed.co.uk API, CV-Library API
   550	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (for the rationale narrative), decision log writer
   551	- **External APIs:** Proxycurl, Reed, CV-Library
   552	- **Gate A:** 5–15 candidates returned per brief; each has a working contact method; each has rationale ≥ 50 words; no candidate flagged "do not contact" in tenant vault
   553	- **Gate B target:** ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)
   554	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the multi-source aggregation logic is the work
   555	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl. Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas. Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it.

No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS.

docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:62:- §8.2 v1.0 build order: **A4 Cash Conductor (Tier 1, weeks 7-8)** and **A6 Concierge (Tier 1, weeks 9-10)** require it.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:121:- v1.0 build: **A6 Concierge** (master brief §8.2, weeks 9-10) holds candidate-lifecycle state across days; loses context-rollover gracefulness if this primitive fails.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:182:1. **No `chokidar` watcher in the bus.** The bus is poll-based, not push-based. `grep -rn chokidar src/` returns zero hits; `chokidar@^5.0.0` in `package.json:47` is used only by `dashboard/src/lib/watcher.ts:5` for the dashboard UI's file change feed, not for inter-agent message delivery. Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:189:- §8.2 v1.1: A8 **Brief Decoder** is the load-bearing test of the file bus + handoff to Sourcing Scout → Concierge (Ultraplan §3.1 row 3: "This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2"). v1.0 agents don't strictly depend on the bus for inter-agent handoff — but they do depend on it for KB read/write.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:257:- v1.1: A7 Inbound Triage's auto-send is the most dangerous; per Ultraplan §8.2 A7 gotcha: "Misclassification of a complaint as a routine inbound is a relationship killer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:390:- v1.1: **A11 Night Sourcer** (Ultraplan §8.2, weeks 9-10) is the canonical use case — "8-12 reviewed candidates per brief every morning at 06:30" (Product Spec §2.2 R4).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:393:**Risk if flaky:** Night Sourcer becomes a daytime cron with rate-limit pain — kills the "Walk in to 27 reviewed candidates across your live briefs every morning" pitch (Product Spec §10 line 525). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6: "LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected → defer Night Sourcer to v1.2 if needed" — overnight autoresearch is also the budgeting layer for the LinkedIn rate limit (Ultraplan §8.2 A11 gotcha: "Build the rate-limit budget allocator carefully; this is where £40-60/mo of the £200 per-tenant compute cost lives").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff. Ultraplan §3.1 row 3 already names this as the bus's load-bearing test ("This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2").
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:165:Concierge is the Tier-1 always-on candidate-lifecycle agent per master brief §8.2 A6 and Product Spec §2.2 R7. v1.0 build weeks 10-13. First user of the rendered output is the renderer's own integration test; production first-user is the first paid pilot in Q3 2026.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:767:**First production render:** the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4 — this is also the first end-to-end proof that the renderer works against a real bundle. Subsequent renders for Janitor (Week 5), Scribe (Week 6), Cash Conductor (Weeks 7-8), Sourcing Scout (Week 9), and Concierge (Weeks 10-13) extend the validation surface.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:72:- **The file bus.** Inter-agent handoff via shared filesystem directories. No queue, no API, no serialisation tax. Brief Decoder writes a parsed-brief file; Sourcing Scout's `FastChecker` polls it up at the configured cadence (default 1000ms `pollInterval`, configurable per agent); result lands in a sub-directory the Concierge is polling. Four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound.

A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:136:**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.

docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:24:Operational consequence: end-to-end latency of an N-hop agent pipeline is **bounded below by N × `pollInterval`**. At the default 1000ms with the 4-agent Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (3 hops), the floor is ≥3 seconds. The current master brief §3.2 / Ultraplan §3.2 narrative ("four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes") is technically consistent with this floor at 1000ms — but only just, and a customer-facing claim of "sub-second handoff" would be wrong.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:17:Master brief §8.2 (lines 597-611) names six v1.0 agents and assigns build weeks:

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:185:W9:   Sourcing Scout (A5)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).

docs/operations/w4-bilateral-pass-6-agent-md.md:122:  - **Codex says:** "It flips to Accepted on ratification/founder questions/ADR-006 before the W9 bundle exists, but the agent-bundle skill treats Accepted as production-ready after sibling files + fixtures exist and pass gates. Fix by keeping this scaffold Proposed after ratification, and make Proposed → Accepted depend on W9 build completion: `tools.yaml`, `context.sh`, `validate.sh`, `cycle.sh`, `cleanup.sh`, and 3 fixtures."
docs/operations/w4-bilateral-pass-6-agent-md.md:123:  - **Likely:** FIX-IN-PLACE. Edit §10 to gate Accepted on W9 bundle completion (sibling files + fixtures + gate A). Ratified scaffold stays at "Proposed (Ratified at Round-N)" until W9.

After this pass, recommend a CI grep that flags any `agent.md` field reference whose name doesn't appear in `vertical-schema.yaml` OR `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml`.
docs/operations/w4-bilateral-pass-6-agent-md.md:236:5. **Status semantics** (Sourcing Scout #2) — confirm with founder: "Ratified at Round-N" is not "Accepted"; Accepted requires bundle completion.

 succeeded in 0ms:
   260	- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)
   261	
   262	Gate A failure routing by class:
   263	- PII leakage → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall)
   264	- Output-shape failures (count not in 5-15, contact-method missing, rationale <50 words, voice classifier miss, all-source-failure-without-degradation) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
   265	Draft to `/tmp`; operator review.
   266	
   267	**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
   268	
   269	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   270	
   271	Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.
   272	
   273	Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply (v1.0). Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant. NOTE: Bullhorn-note feedback is NOT a v1.0 path (Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn per §1 + §6 contracts; would require write capability not in v1.0 scope).
   274	
   275	Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).
   276	
   277	Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.
   278	
   279	---
   280	
   281	## §6 — Escalation codes
   282	
   283	Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
   284	
   285	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   286	|---|---|---|---|
   287	| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   288	| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | LinkedIn / Proxycurl session/OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   289	| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   290	| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   291	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / linkedin / reed / cv-library) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   292	| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   293	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
   294	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   295	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   296	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |
   297	
   298	Sourcing Scout does NOT use:
   299	
   300	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
   301	- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
   302	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
   303	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
   304	- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.
   305	
   306	---
   307	
   308	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   309	
   310	Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   311	
   312	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
   313	  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
   314	  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
   315	  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
   316	  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
   317	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
   318	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.
   319	
   320	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
   321	
   322	---
   323	
   324	## §8 — Build dependencies (W9 prerequisites)
   325	
   326	Sourcing Scout build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:
   327	
   328	| Dependency | Source | Status |
   329	|---|---|---|
   330	| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
   331	| Diagnostic ratified | Week 3 Codex Round 4 | ⏸ |
   332	| Janitor ratified (Bullhorn-read substrate) | W5 Codex Round | ⏸ |
   333	| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
   334	| **Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ |
   335	| Bullhorn MCP read capability | W3-W4-W5 build chain | ⏸ |
   336	| **Proxycurl commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial; ~$39+/mo | ⏸ |
   337	| **Reed.co.uk commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
   338	| **CV-Library commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
   339	| Proxycurl MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   340	| Reed MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   341	| CV-Library MCP connector | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   342	| Source-abstraction layer (Night Sourcer reuse) | W9 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   343	| Per-tenant source credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
   344	| Tenant DNC list populated in `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-backed structured state per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
   345	| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
   346	| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W9 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
   347	| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W9 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
   348	| `cycle.sh` orchestration (11-step) | Build at W9 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   349	| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W9 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
   350	
   351	**Pre-W9-build prerequisites (must resolve to ✅ before W9 starts):** all items listed up to and including "Tenant DNC list populated", "Voice corpus seeded", and "Per-tenant source credentials in _secrets.env" — these are FOUNDER/TENANT-ADMIN actions that the W9 build cannot deliver itself. The four sibling-bundle items below (validate.sh, context.sh, cycle.sh, fixtures) ARE the W9 build slice itself — those are deliverables not prerequisites. Their completion is the W9-build-end Status-flip criterion (Proposed → Accepted), not the W9-build-start gate.
   352	
   353	---
   354	
   355	## §9 — Status + open questions
   356	
   357	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.
   358	
   359	### Open questions for founder review
   360	
   361	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   362	|---|---|---|
   363	| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
   364	| Q2 | Proxycurl pricing — ~$39/mo for 5,000 credits at low volume; scales with usage. Per pilot tenant budget? | ~5-10 briefs/day per consultant × 50 calls/brief = up to 2,500 credits/day per consultant. Cost: ~$20-50/day at peak. |
   365	| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
   366	| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
   367	| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback (Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet) | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful" → `decision_log` row via `consultant_feedback` green-tier action_type. v1.1: Brain UI button. NOTE: Bullhorn-note-based feedback is NOT a v1.0 path — Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn (no write capability); Bullhorn note creation would require tools.yaml write capability + autosend/decision logging which v1.0 explicitly excludes. |
   368	| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
   369	| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |
   370	
   371	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)
   372	
   373	1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
   374	2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
   375	3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.
   376	
   377	---
   378	
   379	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   380	
   381	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built 2026-05-24, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED verdict on the SCAFFOLD shape (output contract + workflow + gates + escalation + dependencies). **Ratification of the scaffold does NOT make it Accepted.** Per the agent-bundle skill, Accepted means production-ready — which requires all sibling bundle files + fixtures + first production run.
   382	
   383	**Three-state lifecycle:**
   384	
   385	1. **Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold** when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED on this agent.md alone. Pre-build scaffold confirmed shape-correct; the document is a binding contract for the W9 build slice.
   386	
   387	2. **Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted** when ALL:
   388	   - W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files (`tools.yaml`, `context.sh`, `validate.sh`, `cycle.sh`, `cleanup.sh`) + 3 fixtures with golden outputs
   389	   - Codex re-ratifies the full bundle (agent.md + siblings + fixtures) post-build
   390	   - Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
   391	   - Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
   392	   - Q6: source-abstraction-layer ADR drafted + ratified (new ADR — not the same as ADR-006 which is Diagnostic Gate A; number assigned at authoring time)
   393	
   394	3. **Accepted → In Force** when:
   395	   - First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
   396	   - Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram /scout-feedback path; Brain UI in v1.1)
   397	   - First production render against a pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   398	
   399	Until W9 build: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

     3	**Status:** Proposed.
     4	**Build state:** Day-20 W4 bilateral pass + R19 substantive fix applied. R9 added §10 three-state lifecycle clarification (Proposed → Ratified-as-Scaffold → Accepted → In Force; ratification ≠ acceptance per agent-bundle skill) + §4 Step 8 + Schema-key block rewrite for `blocked_recipients`. R19 (today): adds `blocked_recipients` declaration to v0.3 supplement §4 tenant_adapters_config_additions per Codex Finding 1. Awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice.
     5	
     6	**Schema-key references:**
     7	- `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — registered in `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (line 397); canonical Postgres-backed v1.0 DNC source per ADR-002. YAML schema declaration deferred to future schema-doc audit (covers all pre-v0.3 allowlist keys not yet declared in YAML).
     8	- `tenant_adapters.config.auto_source_on_brief_create` — v0.4-supplement-pending (not yet in any allowlist); the Bullhorn-webhook auto-source trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 lands.

    12	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
    13	**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

    17	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

    19	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    20	
    21	> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button OR Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`). Bullhorn "new brief" webhook auto-source (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547) is DEFERRED to v1.1+ — blocked on `auto_source_on_brief_create` config key landing in a v0.4 supplement. Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

   107	## §4 — Workflow
   108	
   109	11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
   110	
   111	```
   112	0. Session start
   113	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
   114	     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-
   115	     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
   116	     registered config key)
   117	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")
   118	
   119	1. Brief ingestion
   120	   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   121	   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
   122	     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   123	   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
   124	     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   125	   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
   126	     "key_dims:<N>")
   127	
   128	2. Multi-source auth refresh
   129	   → bullhorn (read-only); LinkedIn/Proxycurl; Reed; CV-Library
   130	   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
   131	     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
   132	     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
   133	       enters degraded mode per catalogue ("drafts-only, no auto-send" —
   134	       Sourcing-Scout-specific interpretation: skip Bullhorn source +
   135	       continue with other 3 sources, since Sourcing Scout has no
   136	       auto-send path of its own; the "drafts-only" framing maps to
   137	       "report-only with Bullhorn data omitted from the sourcing set")
   138	     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
   139	       (Sourcing Scout: cached LinkedIn search only; live profile fetches
   140	       skipped)
   141	     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
   142	       Reed search results only)
   143	     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
   144	       (cached CV-Library search only)
   145	   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
   146	     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
   147	     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   148	   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
   149	     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>")
   150	
   151	3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   152	   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
   153	     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
   154	     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
   155	     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
   156	     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
   157	     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
   158	     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
   159	     modification recency within the active set.
   160	   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   161	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   162	   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   163	
   164	4. LinkedIn search (via Proxycurl)
   165	   → proxycurl.search_people(query=brief_key_dimensions, location=brief_location,
   166	     industry=brief_sector)
   167	   → up to 30 profiles
   168	   → cache 1h per (query, location, sector) tuple
   169	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Proxycurl quota hit (payload.upstream='linkedin')
   170	   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   171	
   172	5. Reed query
   173	   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   174	   → up to 30 candidates
   175	   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
   176	     (payload.upstream='reed')
   177	   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   178	
   179	6. CV-Library query
   180	   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   181	   → up to 30 candidates
   182	   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
   183	     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   184	   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   185	
   186	7. Aggregate + dedupe
   187	   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   188	   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
   189	     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   190	   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + LinkedIn
   191	     match" if found in both)
   192	   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
   193	     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")
   194	
   195	8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   196	   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients`
   197	     (concept referenced by autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
   198	     `send_to_blocked_recipient` action_type + ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT catalogue
   199	     §2.10; the config key IS registered in the canonical authority
   200	     `migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §5` validator allowlist (line 397).
   201	     v0.4-pending status applies ONLY to `auto_source_on_brief_create`
   202	     (the webhook auto-source trigger config), NOT to `blocked_recipients`.
   203	     Postgres-backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — NOT vault markdown.
   204	     Future schema-doc audit will land `blocked_recipients` declaration
   205	     in the YAML schema files alongside other pre-v0.3 allowlist keys.)
   206	   → remove any candidate matching any DNC identifier from the sourcing list
   207	   → log dropped candidates to exception list in §3 output
   208	   → NOTE: ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT is catalogue §2.10 reserved for OUTBOUND SEND
   209	     REFUSAL specifically. Sourcing Scout filters DNC matches AT SOURCING
   210	     TIME (pre-outbound); no outbound send attempt occurs. v0.3 disposition:
   211	     log DNC drops in exception list only; no ESC fire. W4-polish backlog:
   212	     add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER for the pre-outbound case.
   213	   → hh_decision_output("dnc_filter", "brief:<id>",
   214	     "dropped:<N>; kept:<N>")
   215	
   216	9. LLM ranking + rationale generation (per candidate)
   217	   → for top 15 by source-aggregated confidence: generate per-candidate
   218	     rationale ≥50 words
   219	   → prompt = (brief context + candidate profile + voice corpus + tone rules)
   220	   → voice classifier scores rationale (≥0.75)
   221	   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries; drop candidate
   222	     from final list
   223	   → hh_decision_output("candidate_proposed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id|external_ref>",
   224	     "source:<bullhorn|linkedin|reed|cvlibrary>; confidence:<N>; voice_score:<N>; included:<bool>") — emitted PER CANDIDATE per §3 contract (one row per candidate proposed; dropped candidates also get a row with included=false + drop_reason)
   225	
   226	10. Output assembly + Gate A validation
   227	    → ensure 5-15 candidates remaining after Step 9
   228	    → ensure each has working contact method (email validated via simple
   229	      regex + domain MX check; phone validated via E.164 format)
   230	    → ensure each rationale ≥50 words
   231	    → if any condition fails: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE (output-shape violation
   232	      per catalogue line 184 — distinct from ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION which is
   233	      reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time);
   234	      partial draft to /tmp; abort
   235	    → write Markdown report to vault path per §3
   236	    → hh_decision_output("scout_report", report_path, "N candidates from M sources")
   237	
   238	11. Session close + notification
   239	    → operator notification per invocation source (Brain UI: in-app
   240	      notification; Telegram: reply with report path; webhook: bus event back)
   241	    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
   242	      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
   243	    → exit code 0
   244	```

   248	## §5 — Gates
   249	
   250	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   251	
   252	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):
   253	
   254	- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
   255	- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
   256	- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
   257	- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
   258	- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
   259	- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text → fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (BLOCKING per catalogue §2.5 lines 148-154; halts immediately, not warn-only output-shape)
   260	- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)

   591	### 8.2 The build order — v1.0 only
   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).
   605	
   560	```
   561	
   562	**The bundle at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` is the source artefact; the cortextOS daemon does not read it directly.** The renderer (`packages/agent-renderer/`, per `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` and `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) translates the bundle into a cortextOS-shaped per-agent directory at `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` per-tenant. Source bundle authored once; rendered N times (once per active tenant). The `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command is **NOT** the IFOS path — it inherits 24 cortextOS template skills the IFOS bundle does not want.
   563	
   564	### 8.1 The three v2 changes (Ultraplan §4.2)
   565	
   566	**Change 1 — Voice handling moves into `_shared/voice-loader.sh`.** No agent reads the voice corpus directly. Every `context.sh` calls `hh_load_tone_rules`, `hh_load_voice_samples`, `hh_load_recent_edits`. Agent context scripts become 30 lines, not 200.
   567	
   568	**Change 2 — Decision logging is enforced.** Three required calls per agent run:
   569	
   570	```bash
   571	hh_decision_trigger   # at start; logs trigger
   572	hh_decision_output    # on output; logs the artefact
   573	hh_decision_action    # when human acts; logs the action
   574	```
   575	
   576	`validate.sh` hard-fails on missing calls. This is what enables the v2.0 LoRA pipeline — no decision log, no SFT corpus, no Scale-tier moat.
   577	
   578	**Change 3 — Escalation codes expand to recruitment vocabulary.** ~20–30 codes. Examples:
   579	
   580	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` — voice classifier score below threshold after retries
   581	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — OAuth token expired/revoked
   582	- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — high-confidence dedup needs human review
   583	- `ESC_JSL_RED_FLAG` — Supply Chain Auditor detected red flag
   584	- `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   585	- `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` — output references PII outside firm boundary
   586	- `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` — upstream API rate-limited (esp. LinkedIn)
   587	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — agent produced output violating vertical schema
   588	
   589	Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.

   101	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   102	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type` (one of `refresh_failed`, `revoked_401`), `last_attempt_at`, `consecutive_failures`
   103	- **Recovery:** agent stays in degraded mode until founder rotates token via Bullhorn admin → next `_secrets.env` reload picks up new token

     1	# Auto-send safety policy
     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed — pending Codex Day-7 ratification
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-18 (Week 0, Day 5)
     5	**Author:** Claude Code, with founder review pending
     6	**Master brief §:** §6 Day 5 (line 485) + §8.1 Change 2 (`hh_decision_*` contract) + §3.2 (adapter boundary)
     7	**Surfaced by:** Master brief Day 5 spec; load-bearing for every `hh_decision_action` call across the v1.0 agent fleet.
     8	**Path drift logged:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 485 specifies `docs/auto-send-safety-policy.md` (docs/ root). This artefact lives at `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` per repo convention since Day 0 (matching ADR-001/-002/-003, bullhorn-integration-path, sequencing-target, brain-ui-scope). Recorded as **Edit 10** in atomic-correction manifest.
     9	
    10	---
    11	
    12	## §1 — Scope
    13	
    14	This policy governs **every agent action that produces a side effect outside the IFOS-internal data layer**. The internal data layer is:
    15	
    16	- The vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`) — markdown + YAML, IFOS-controlled
    17	- The Postgres data tables (`entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`, `tenant_eval_sets`, `tenant_adapters`, `tenants`) — IFOS-controlled, RLS-isolated
    18	- The pgvector indexes over the above
    19	- The cortextOS file bus and PM2 process tree
    20	
    21	**Actions inside the internal data layer are not governed by this policy** (they are governed by RLS + the master brief §3.3 vault/Postgres split + the decision_log append-only enforcement).
    22	
    23	**Actions that ARE governed:**
    24	
    25	1. Writes to any external system via MCP connector (Bullhorn, Companies House, Xero, Microsoft Graph, etc.) — every `tools.yaml`-declared write scope
    26	2. Sends to humans via any communication channel (email, SMS, Telegram, Slack, LinkedIn InMail, calendar invite, etc.) — both customer-facing and consultant-internal where the consultant is not the agent's directly-supervising user
    27	3. Reads from external systems that touch PII or have rate-limit/cost implications (LinkedIn profile lookups, Companies House director searches)
    28	4. Any action declared as side-effecting in `tools.yaml` for an agent, regardless of category
    29	
    30	**Out of scope:**
    31	
    32	- Read-only IFOS internal queries (entities, decision_log reads via context-assembly API)
    33	- Render-time renderer operations (writing rendered agent dirs to `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/`)
    34	- Vault local writes by the agent's own validate.sh / context.sh / fixture runs
    35	- Codex ratification artefacts (read-only review)
    36	
    37	If an action's scope is ambiguous, default to **governed** and require classification.
    38	
    39	**Founder Decision D1 pending (Codex Round 2 rejection).** The v1.0 tier semantics in this document define orange as approval-gated. §9 says v1.0 ships green + red only. These are contradictory until D1 resolves. See `docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md` §D1 for options + Claude's recommended path (D1-B with the bridge spec at `docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md`). Until D1 resolves, treat this policy as "Proposed for D1-B; subset In Force for green + red only".
    40	
    41	---
    42	
    43	## §2 — Tier model
    44	
    45	Four-tier traffic light. Every governed action falls into exactly one tier at every moment of execution. Tiers are properties of the **(action_type × tenant_override)** pair, not of the agent.
    46	
    47	### Green — auto-send allowed without review
    48	
    49	Side effects allowed. The action proceeds immediately. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='green'` is written.
    50	
    51	**Default characteristics:** idempotent OR internal-to-tenant OR read-only against external systems with rate-limit budget remaining OR low-cost-to-reverse (e.g., add a Bullhorn tag that can be removed in <30s).
    52	
    53	### Yellow — auto-send allowed with sampled spot-check
    54	
    55	Side effects allowed. The action proceeds immediately. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='yellow'` is written. Additionally, a sampling check fires (1-in-N per `action_type`; default N=10). On sampling, the action is enqueued for **human spot-check review** by the tenant operator within 24 hours of execution. Spot-check disagreement triggers retrospective review of the policy tier classification (potential tier elevation via tenant override).
    56	
    57	**Default characteristics:** high-volume actions where systematic per-action review is too slow but where systematic blind trust is too risky; sampled review provides quality signal without operational drag.
    58	
    59	### Orange — requires human approval before send
    60	
    61	Side effects blocked at agent layer. The agent halts at `hh_decision_action` invocation. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='orange'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` fires (see §5). The cortextOS approval gate (primitive 4 per master brief §2.4) opens, Telegram bot notifies the tenant's designated approver (primitive 5), agent blocks until human resolves with `approve` / `reject` / `escalate-up`. Approval grants single-execution authority for the specific action_type + target + payload_hash — not a standing authorisation.
    62	
    63	**Default characteristics:** moderate-to-high cost-to-reverse OR customer-facing comms OR irreversible state changes.
    64	
    65	### Red — blocked entirely
    66	
    67	Side effects refused. Agent does not get the chance to invoke. `decision_log` row with `phase='gating_failed'` and `payload.tier='red'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` fires (see §5). The agent must take a different code path or abort. **Red tier cannot be relaxed by tenant override.** Red is the floor for tier overrides per §8.
    68	
    69	**Default characteristics:** financial/legal/cross-tenant/PII boundaries; structural integrity of the IFOS multi-tenant model.
    70	
    71	---
    72	
    73	## §3 — Examples per tier across the v1.0 agent surface
    74	
    75	Six v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge. Each action below has a v1.0 default tier; tenant overrides can elevate (see §8).
    76	
    77	### Green examples (auto-send without review)
    78	
    79	| Agent | action_type | Why green |
    80	|---|---|---|
    81	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_report_render` | Internal artefact write; no external comms; idempotent (re-render overwrites) |
    82	| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_tag` | Adds a tag with `checked_at` date; reversible in <30s; high volume |
    83	| Scribe | `bullhorn_note_internal` | Writes to internal-only Bullhorn note section (`isExternal: false`); visible only to consultant; non-customer-facing |
    84	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_profile_cache` | Stores profile snapshot to `/vault/<tenant>/wiki/raw/`; no external send; no rate-limit cost |
    85	| Cash Conductor | `xero_query_invoices` | Read-only against Xero; rate-limited via Xero's own quotas; no side effect |
    86	| Concierge | `bullhorn_brief_read` | Read of inbound brief; idempotent; no comms |
    87	
    88	### Yellow examples (auto-send with spot-check sampling)
    89	
    90	| Agent | action_type | Sample rate | Why yellow |
    91	|---|---|---|---|
    92	| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` | 1-in-10 | Merges duplicate candidate records; reversible but high-volume; merge quality needs ongoing review |
    93	| Scribe | `bullhorn_note_append_summary` | 1-in-20 | Appends to candidate record; visible to consultant only; high-volume; format quality needs review |
    94	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_connection_request` | 1-in-5 | Outbound LinkedIn action subject to rate limits + reputation effects; sample for tone + targeting accuracy |
    95	| Cash Conductor | `xero_reminder_draft_internal` | 1-in-10 | Generates reminder draft visible to consultant; not yet sent; format + tone needs review |
    96	| Concierge | `bullhorn_note_draft_internal` | 1-in-10 | Drafts a Bullhorn Note for consultant review (not yet sent); high-volume; voice drift candidate |
    97	
    98	### Orange examples (per-action human approval)
    99	
   100	| Agent | action_type | Why orange |
   101	|---|---|---|
   102	| **Concierge** | **`bullhorn_note_customer_visible`** | **CANONICAL ORANGE.** Writes a Bullhorn Note with `isExternal: true` (or equivalent) that becomes visible to the customer's full team in their CRM. Single send is irreversible (note remains in audit trail even if deleted). Source: `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 (establishes Concierge produces Notes on every lifecycle-event communication) + §6.3 (explicit sensitivity framing: "Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI"). |
   103	| Concierge | `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` | Outbound email to candidate; customer-facing; reputation effects |
   104	| Concierge | `twilio_sms_send` | Outbound SMS; high-trust channel; cost-per-send; irreversible |
   105	| Concierge | `calendar_invite_send` | Creates calendar event with attendee notification; visible to attendee |
   106	| Scribe | `email_summary_to_customer` | Outbound email summarising call to customer; customer-facing; format-sensitive |
   107	| Cash Conductor | `xero_reminder_send_customer` | Outbound payment reminder to customer; reputation + collection risk |
   108	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_email_send` | Outbound diagnostic report to prospect; sales-stage outreach; reputation |
   109	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_calendar_invite` | Books intro call with prospect; reputation + scheduling friction |
   110	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_inmail_send` | Outbound InMail (paid credit); cost-per-send; customer-facing |
   111	| Janitor | `bullhorn_placement_terminate` | Marks placement as terminated; commercial/legal implications; reversible only via support ticket |
   112	
   113	### Red examples (blocked entirely; `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`)
   114	
   115	| action_type | block_reason | Why red |
   116	|---|---|---|
   117	| `xero_payment_initiate` | `payment_action` | Payment transfer; financial-bearing; never auto-send in v1.0 |
   118	| `stripe_charge_initiate` | `payment_action` | Charges a card; financial-bearing |
   119	| `subscription_modify` | `billing_modification` | Changes tenant's IFOS subscription; structurally distinct from agent work |
   120	| `legal_document_generate` | `legal_artefact` | Offer letters, employment contracts; legal-binding |
   121	| `pii_export_outside_tenant_geography` | `pii_geographic_breach` | PII transmitted outside tenant's declared data residency (e.g., GDPR boundary breach) |
   122	| `cross_tenant_data_send` | `cross_tenant_violation` | Sending tenant-A data to tenant-B recipient; structurally enforced by RLS but red-listed for defence-in-depth |
   123	| `unauthorised_adapter_send` | `unauthorized_adapter` | Send via an adapter not declared in this tenant's `tenant_adapters` row + `tools.yaml` |
   124	| `send_to_blocked_recipient` | `blocked_recipient` | Recipient in tenant's `blocked_recipients` override list |
   125	
   126	---
   127	
   128	## §4 — Integration with the `hh_decision_action` contract
   129	
   130	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 and ADR-003 Decision 3 §2.1, every agent run emits three `decision_log` rows via:
   131	
   132	- `hh_decision_trigger` — at session start; logs the trigger
   133	- `hh_decision_output` — when the agent produces its output artefact
   134	- `hh_decision_action` — when an action is taken (or blocked)
   135	
   136	The policy gates **the `hh_decision_action` call specifically**. Implementation lives in `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (Week-1 prerequisite per ADR-002 §"For Week 1 work"). The policy is the **specification** that hook-helpers.sh implements against.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:58:      Per-tenant pack of source documents that define the firm's outbound voice — emails the consultant has written, prior Bullhorn Notes, marketing copy, founder-curated style examples. Read by hh_load_voice_samples (semantic ANN retrieval against the embedded chunks). One voice_corpus per tenant; versioned so re-indexing produces a new row rather than mutating the live pack.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:120:      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:123:  tone_rule:
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:125:      Per-tenant tone constraints expressed as rules. Read by hh_load_tone_rules at session start; constraints are surfaced to the agent as part of the context-assembly bundle (master brief §9). Distinct from voice_corpus: voice_corpus is implicit (semantic similarity); tone_rule is explicit (declarative).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:140:        notes: Stable slug, e.g. "no-i-hope-this-finds-you-well". Referenced by recent_edit when a rule fires.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:151:          Enum: ["info", "warn", "block"]. `info` is observational (logged, not enforced); `warn` shows up in decision_log without blocking; `block` is a Gate-A hard-fail (causes regenerate-with-feedback per Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:157:          Items: agent_name slugs from master brief §8.2 (e.g. ["scribe", "concierge"]). Empty array = applies to all agents. tone_rule rows MUST set this to at least one agent; "all agents" requires the empty-array literal.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:186:      Tone rules are the explicit complement to voice_corpus's implicit grounding. v0.2 ships with ~5-15 rules per tenant (curated at onboarding). v1.1 grows the rule library based on recent_edit patterns (tenant-specific drift becomes a rule).

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:259:      recent_edit is the most privacy-sensitive entity in v0.2 because it stores raw agent output (potentially including names, salaries, etc. — anything the agent drafted). RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:269:      Semantic-search index over voice_corpus text chunks. Read by hh_load_voice_samples to retrieve the top-K most-relevant voice samples for the agent's current task context.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:806:    rationale: Notes operationally ARE the audit trail (autosend-policy.md §7 confirms); decision_log has RLS + tier metadata + payload_hash for audit; avoid dual-storage problem at v1.0; cheap to promote later if needed.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:816:    decision: System agent names like `_renderer` are NOT entity_types in this schema.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS. Every tenant runs the same agent fleet (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge in v1.0) against their own data, isolated from every other tenant's data. **A single cross-tenant data leak is a catastrophic failure mode** — it breaches the GDPR contract, violates pilot LOI terms, and burns customer trust. There is no "minor" cross-tenant leak.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:72:- **The file bus.** Inter-agent handoff via shared filesystem directories. No queue, no API, no serialisation tax. Brief Decoder writes a parsed-brief file; Sourcing Scout's `FastChecker` polls it up at the configured cadence (default 1000ms `pollInterval`, configurable per agent); result lands in a sub-directory the Concierge is polling. Four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound.

docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:182:1. **No `chokidar` watcher in the bus.** The bus is poll-based, not push-based. `grep -rn chokidar src/` returns zero hits; `chokidar@^5.0.0` in `package.json:47` is used only by `dashboard/src/lib/watcher.ts:5` for the dashboard UI's file change feed, not for inter-agent message delivery. Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:189:- §8.2 v1.1: A8 **Brief Decoder** is the load-bearing test of the file bus + handoff to Sourcing Scout → Concierge (Ultraplan §3.1 row 3: "This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2"). v1.0 agents don't strictly depend on the bus for inter-agent handoff — but they do depend on it for KB read/write.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff. Ultraplan §3.1 row 3 already names this as the bus's load-bearing test ("This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2").
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:1:# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:21:> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button OR Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`). Bullhorn "new brief" webhook auto-source (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547) is DEFERRED to v1.1+ — blocked on `auto_source_on_brief_create` config key landing in a v0.4 supplement. Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:267:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:273:Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply (v1.0). Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant. NOTE: Bullhorn-note feedback is NOT a v1.0 path (Sourcing Scout is read-only on Bullhorn per §1 + §6 contracts; would require write capability not in v1.0 scope).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:275:Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger.

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:303:- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:304:- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:312:- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:318:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.

Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:136:**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:334:- The agent fleet of 6 named in master brief §8.2 (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge)
docs/decisions/2026-05-18-day-7-single-sentence-test.md:55:- **Build decision: YES.** Bullhorn-first per master brief §8.2 + `docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md` §4.1 (Diagnostic W3-4 → Janitor W5 → Scribe W6 → Cash Conductor W7-8 → Sourcing Scout W9 → Concierge W10-13). Sub-decision C of `bullhorn-integration-path.md` (v1.0 endpoint surface, 4 agents, pull-only, refresh-loop architecture for 10-min token TTL) Accepted Day 2.
docs/decisions/2026-05-18-day-7-single-sentence-test.md:103:- **Week 1 named agent-build slices DO NOT BEGIN.** Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, Scribe W6, Cash Conductor W7-8, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13 — all blocked.

docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:75:- Sourcing Scout (W9) touches Bullhorn read; same gating
docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:78:**Net effect of worst case (Bullhorn never responds + Direct-API forced):** Janitor + Scribe + Sourcing Scout + Concierge all slip ~1 week each; Cash Conductor (W7-8) unaffected; v1.0 ships in W14 instead of W13. Master brief §8.2 line 604 acknowledges this contingency.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:24:Operational consequence: end-to-end latency of an N-hop agent pipeline is **bounded below by N × `pollInterval`**. At the default 1000ms with the 4-agent Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (3 hops), the floor is ≥3 seconds. The current master brief §3.2 / Ultraplan §3.2 narrative ("four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes") is technically consistent with this floor at 1000ms — but only just, and a customer-facing claim of "sub-second handoff" would be wrong.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:25:| A5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | "First daytime always-on agent" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:146:### 2.5 — A5 Sourcing Scout (daytime)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:185:W9:   Sourcing Scout (A5)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).

Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:310:- **Activation:** v1.0 scope cut from 6 to 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 row #4 — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1; founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:317:- **Activation:** Cash Conductor's W7-8 anchor slips. If Hire #1 starts W8 → Cash Conductor W8-9 (sequence preserved, just shifts right); if Hire #1 starts W9+ → Trigger 2 activates as fallback (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout).

REJECTED

1. Stale schema declaration claim for `blocked_recipients`. Lines 7 and 203-205 say the YAML declaration is deferred to a future schema-doc audit, but line 4 says R19 added it, and `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` already declares `blocked_recipients` at lines 810-827. Fix by replacing the deferred-schema wording with a citation to the v0.3 supplement declaration.

2. §7 reads `recent_edit` without schema access. Line 318 says Sourcing Scout calls `hh_load_recent_edits` to read the last 30 days, but `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` grants Sourcing Scout `recent_edit` access as `W`, not `R` or `R+W`, at lines 584-593 and 715-724. Fix by either removing the `hh_load_recent_edits` read from this agent or amending the schema supplement to grant `R+W`.

3. Gate A failure path produces a draft and aborts without a mandatory decision-log write. Lines 231-234 say validation failure writes a partial draft to `/tmp` and aborts before the `hh_decision_output("scout_report", ...)` call on line 236; lines 262-265 repeat the failure routing without a `hh_decision_*` call. Fix by adding an explicit `hh_decision_action("validate_gate_a_fail", ...)` or `hh_decision_output` for the partial draft before aborting, aligned with `autosend-policy.yaml` lines 119-123.

1. Stale schema declaration claim for `blocked_recipients`. Lines 7 and 203-205 say the YAML declaration is deferred to a future schema-doc audit, but line 4 says R19 added it, and `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` already declares `blocked_recipients` at lines 810-827. Fix by replacing the deferred-schema wording with a citation to the v0.3 supplement declaration.

2. §7 reads `recent_edit` without schema access. Line 318 says Sourcing Scout calls `hh_load_recent_edits` to read the last 30 days, but `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` grants Sourcing Scout `recent_edit` access as `W`, not `R` or `R+W`, at lines 584-593 and 715-724. Fix by either removing the `hh_load_recent_edits` read from this agent or amending the schema supplement to grant `R+W`.
