=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Janitor — the wedge agent

**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Cron (v1.0)

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)

```bash
ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
```

`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.

### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: CRNs, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | Composite score: (dedup % improvement × 0.5) + (field-completeness % improvement × 0.5). Target ≥12.5 (≥15% dedup + ≥10% field) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 |
| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |

### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)

Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):

1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 89), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

---

## §4 — Workflow

12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")

1. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)

3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)

4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)

5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 89),
     client.industry (line 252), client.size_employees (line 243),
     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   → identify missing-field rows
   → batch enrichment calls
   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")

6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429

7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
     signup commercial decision)
   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
     current_company → write back

8. Tacit-note harvest
   → query decision_log for recent_edit rows in last 30 days for this tenant
     where resolution='approved_after_edit'
   → group by target_entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)

9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff

10. Day-30 report assembly
   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")

11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")

12. Session close
   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → exit code 0 (or 1 if Gate-B missed for 3 consecutive runs → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)

Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint; per Day-19 catalogue add at `escalation-codes.md` line 184) OR `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (merge-confidence reject; existing line 127) per the failed condition. Draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — that code is reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.

Composite score = (dedup% × 0.5) + (field-completeness% × 0.5). Target ≥12.5.

Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.

Below ≥12.5 for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

**Note:** Codes marked `(new)` in the table below are flagged for addition to `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` at this agent's W5 build slice per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern. Existing codes match `escalation-codes.md` definitions verbatim.

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` (existing, line 97) | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` (existing, line 156) | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` (existing, line 120) | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (existing, line 148) | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (existing Day-19, line 184) | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (existing, line 127) | Merge proposal rejected at validate.sh: confidence below threshold OR activity-window block | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Composite Gate-B score <12.5 for 3 consecutive runs | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_YELLOW_SPOT_CHECK` (new — W5 catalogue add; could alternatively map to existing `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` line 33) | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Janitor does NOT use:

- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)

Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)

1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill: this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-24.
     5	**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
     6	**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
     7	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.

    12	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    13	
    14	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    15	
    16	> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

    20	## §2 — Invocation surface
    21	
    22	### Cron (v1.0)
    23	
    24	```bash
    25	# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
    26	0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
    27	```
    28	
    29	Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.
    30	
    31	### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)
    32	
    33	```bash
    34	ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
    35	```
    36	
    37	`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).
    38	
    39	### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)
    40	
    41	- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
    42	- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)
    43	
    44	---
    45	
    46	## §3 — Output shape
    47	
    48	Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.
    49	
    50	### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report
    51	
    52	Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:
    53	
    54	| # | Section | Content |
    55	|---|---|---|
    56	| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
    57	| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: CRNs, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
    58	| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
    59	| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
    60	| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
    61	| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | Composite score: (dedup % improvement × 0.5) + (field-completeness % improvement × 0.5). Target ≥12.5 (≥15% dedup + ≥10% field) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 |
    62	| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
    63	| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |
    64	
    65	### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)
    66	
    67	Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):
    68	
    69	1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    70	2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 89), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    71	3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).
    72	
    73	Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.
    74

    76	
    77	## §4 — Workflow
    78	
    79	12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
    80	
    81	```
    82	0. Session start
    83	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
    84	     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
    85	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")
    86	
    87	1. Bullhorn auth refresh
    88	   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
    89	     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
    90	   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries
    91	
    92	2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
    93	   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
    94	     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
    95	     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
    96	   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
    97	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)
    98	
    99	3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   100	   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   101	   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   102	   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   103	   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
   104	     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   105	   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
   106	     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)
   107	
   108	4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   109	   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
   110	     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)
   111	
   112	5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   113	   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 89),
   114	     client.industry (line 252), client.size_employees (line 243),
   115	     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
   116	     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   117	   → identify missing-field rows
   118	   → batch enrichment calls
   119	   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")
   120	
   121	6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   122	   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
   123	     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
   124	     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   125	   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   126	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429
   127	
   128	7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   129	   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
   130	     signup commercial decision)
   131	   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
   132	     current_company → write back
   133	
   134	8. Tacit-note harvest
   135	   → query decision_log for recent_edit rows in last 30 days for this tenant
   136	     where resolution='approved_after_edit'
   137	   → group by target_entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   138	   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
   139	     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)
   140	
   141	9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   142	   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
   143	     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   144	   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   145	   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   146	   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff
   147

   171	## §5 — Gates
   172	
   173	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   174	
   175	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:
   176	
   177	- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
   178	- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
   179	- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   180	- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
   181	- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
   182	- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
   183	- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)
   184	
   185	Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint; per Day-19 catalogue add at `escalation-codes.md` line 184) OR `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (merge-confidence reject; existing line 127) per the failed condition. Draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — that code is reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.
   186	
   187	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   188	
   189	Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.
   190	
   191	Composite score = (dedup% × 0.5) + (field-completeness% × 0.5). Target ≥12.5.
   192	
   193	Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.
   194	
   195	Below ≥12.5 for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).
   196	
   197	---
   198	
   199	## §6 — Escalation codes
   200	
   201	**Note:** Codes marked `(new)` in the table below are flagged for addition to `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` at this agent's W5 build slice per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern. Existing codes match `escalation-codes.md` definitions verbatim.
   202	
   203	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   204	|---|---|---|---|
   205	| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` (existing, line 97) | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   206	| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
   207	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` (existing, line 156) | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
   208	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` (existing, line 120) | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   209	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (existing, line 148) | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   210	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (existing Day-19, line 184) | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   211	| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (existing, line 127) | Merge proposal rejected at validate.sh: confidence below threshold OR activity-window block | warn | operator_chat_id |
   212	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Composite Gate-B score <12.5 for 3 consecutive runs | warn | operator_chat_id |
   213	| `ESC_AUTOSEND_YELLOW_SPOT_CHECK` (new — W5 catalogue add; could alternatively map to existing `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` line 33) | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |
   214	
   215	Janitor does NOT use:
   216	
   217	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
   218	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
   219	- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
   220	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
   221	
   222	---
   223	
   224	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   225	
   226	Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   227	
   228	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
   229	  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
   230	  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
   231	  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
   232	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
   233	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.
   234	
   235	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
   236

Manifest §1.7 appended and full outputs written to `logs/codex-ratification/round-2-autonomous/`. D5 skill softening ratified. Bullhorn gate disagreement rejected because the promised source-doc sharpening did not land. Autosend policy, v0.2 supplement, approval bridge, PII purge runbook/script/forward migration, and tenancy audit script remain rejected. **New Risk #11** added for transactionless `SET LOCAL` usage across live DB scripts/helpers. **New Risk #12** added for the PII purge migration/script mismatch with `recent_edit.original_text NOT NULL`.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:60:- 2026-05-16 (Day 2) — Risk #2 status entry updated: Sub-decision C **Accepted** per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4 + §5; Sub-decisions A and B **Proposed** with named reduction triggers (Sunday/Monday commercial conversations). Two staged severity reductions specified (High → Medium on commercial answers; Medium → Low on first Week 3-4 Bullhorn write landing clean). Risk #7 edit count revised from 5 to 6 (Bullhorn decision §6.6 sixth edit added — master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 `service-account for dev` correction). No new risks surfaced from Day 2 — Sub-decisions A and B Proposed is the intended honest state pending commercial verification, not a new risk surface.

Kill criterion specifies 10 binary triggers spanning design-partner gap (Trigger 1 = Week-3 PAUSE), renderer build (Trigger 2 = W3 KILL), Bullhorn auth (Trigger 3 = W5 PIVOT), scope cuts (Trigger 4 from sequencing-target §6.6), autosend miscategorisations (Trigger 5), unit economics + infra cost (Triggers 6+7 = PIVOT), Gate B revenue (Trigger 8 = KILL per master brief example), cortextOS primitive stability (Trigger 9), PII leakage (Trigger 10 = unilateral KILL). **Risk #3 escalated from Medium to High** — zero design partners in pipeline as of Day 5; original "conversation 1" assumption invalidated. **Risk #7 edit count revised from 9 to 10** with new Edit 10 (master brief §6 Day 5 lines 484-485 path drift `docs/` root → `docs/decisions/`).

Week 1 named agent-build slices (Diagnostic W3-4 + 5 downstream) BLOCKED. Extension protocol per single-sentence-test §5: Week-1 prereq 3 (`_shared/` helpers) + `.codex/ratification/` skills build (Day-1 task gap surfaced) + Bullhorn commercial outreach + renderer scaffold continue; named agent-build slices blocked. **Atomic-correction commit landed today at `0e5b2b4`** — master brief reconciliation, 11 of 12 edits applied (Edit 11 dropped per founder decision: already-executed live SQL migration is its own audit trail; Edit 12 = ADR-002 Edit 3 added at Day-7 grounding). Master brief fully reconciled. **Risk #7 closed for atomic-correction commit** — 11 edits batch-applied at `0e5b2b4`; only remaining items are post-Codex-ratification iterations if Codex flags any of the 11 edits or two side effects (Edit 1 col 4 reframe + Edit 4 row merge). Codex Day-7 ratification queue at 21 items + 1 commit; **execution deferred** to extension period per Option C (skills not yet built + Q1 unblocker required first). `gstack` dev-tool installed Day 7 morning (`f5d2956` + `ce4bb33`) — meta-tooling for development; not part of IFOS product per `.agents/learnings/gstack-pin.md`.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:3:**Status:** Proposed (Day-18 pre-W7-8-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7 build slice OR earlier-pull-forward per ADR-005 if Bullhorn delays persist).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 §5.1: this independence is its strategic value when Bullhorn paths are delayed). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are orange-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (consultant approval required before send via Concierge); reconciliation writes are yellow-tier.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:137:14 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:285:Cash Conductor does NOT use Bullhorn-specific codes (no Bullhorn dependency).
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:300:Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:329:**Per ADR-005 §5.1 pull-forward provision:** if Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B answers delay past 2026-06-10, Cash Conductor may be pulled forward from W7-8 to W4-5 because it has zero Bullhorn dependency. The other prerequisites (accounting + Open Banking commercial signups) remain founder-action gates regardless.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:521:- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (write), Fathom (read), Fireflies (read)

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:569:- **Gotchas:** Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks. Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case — get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship.

docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:386:**Do not build out of order.** The Ultraplan §9 sequence is deliberate: Diagnostic before Janitor because Diagnostic needs no Bullhorn, and Bullhorn is the critical path. Janitor before Scribe because Janitor is a one-shot batch (easier first agent) and Scribe is webhook-driven (harder runtime integration).

docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:17:Intel Force OS is the always-on operating system for UK recruitment agencies. It runs on CortexOS as the persistent agent runtime, lives inside each firm's existing stack (Bullhorn / Vincere / Voyager Infinity, Xero / Sage, Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace), and ships as two coordinated product lines — **IntelForce Recruit** for the front office and **IntelForce Temp** for the back office. Together they replace the operational drag of an entire junior team and, more importantly, generate revenue: surfaced BD opportunities, intercepted competitor briefs, faster cash collection, dormant-candidate reactivation, and post-placement nurture that compounds into referrals. The firm pays £499–£6,950/month per front-office tier and a separate £1,950–£5,950/month for the temp sub-platform. Every agent is pitched against a single, quantified outcome the buyer can verify within 90 days. Configuration scales because the moat is the per-vertical schema, not per-customer plumbing — onboarding becomes a 5-day wizard, not a 5-week project.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:137:#### R9. The Janitor — the database becomes an asset
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:139:- **Output contract:** Day-1 cleanup report (the closing artefact in sales): "Your Bullhorn has 47,000 records, 18% duplicates, 31% with stale contact details, 12% past your retention window, 23% with empty right-to-work fields." Day-30 before/after report. Then continuous: every new record cleaned, deduplicated, enriched, and compliance-checked as it lands.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:144:- **Per-tenant config:** ATS connector, retention-policy rules, dedup-confidence threshold, field-completeness targets, deletion approval flow (always human-in-loop for v1).
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:242:| **Solo** (1–4 fee earners) | £499 | Janitor + 1 always-on agent (drafts-only) + Scribe | "Pay back the year inside one extra placement. Save 10+ hours/week of inbox and admin drag." |

docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:344:- Janitor runs against the ATS — produces the day-1 cleanup report.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:430:**1. Every agent now has a quantified revenue story, not just a time-saved story.** The internal business plan and the 24/7 directive had revenue stories for some agents (Cash Conductor, Client Hunter, T5) but not all. Triage was pitched on responsiveness; here it's pitched on "2–4 additional placements/year per consultant from never-lost candidates". Janitor was pitched on database hygiene; here it's pitched on "one reactivated dormant-but-clean candidate per month covers the tier price".
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:453:- **No ATS replacement.** We sit on top of Bullhorn / Vincere / Voyager. We do not become the system of record. This is non-negotiable for two reasons: customer switching cost is too high to replace the ATS, and our defensible IP is the schema layer, not the data store.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:458:- **No free pilots beyond the structured 14-day Janitor cleanup trial.** Free pilots train customers to expect free.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:472:- The Janitor (the wedge agent; lowest risk, highest visible value)

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:218:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:220:- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:233:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:280:### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:282:1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:284:3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:295:- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:416:The `decision_log` finding from Q1.4 is load-bearing here: every write operation triggers `hh_decision_*` calls per master brief §8.1 Change 2 (lines 170-173). The `entity-history` operation reads from the Postgres `decision_log` table, **not** from a separate per-entity history file. This is why the master brief's `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 is a spec gap (2.1-B) — there are two candidates for "where history lives" and only one of them is in the master brief.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:424:| `search-by-relationship` | Janitor (v1.0): all Candidates linked to Brief X for dedup | v1.0 | `(from_id: str, link_type: str, tenant_id: str)` | `List[EntityRef]` | few seconds | Postgres `entity_graph` traversal; one-hop only in v1.0, multi-hop deferred to graph view v1.2 |

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:459:  - **Git:** **Spec gap 2.4-A.** Neither master brief nor Ultraplan specifies whether `/vault/{tenant}/` is also a git repo. Obsidian users typically git-init their vaults. **Recommendation:** yes — initialize `/vault/{tenant}/.git/` at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder gets free history, blame, and rollback via Obsidian Git plugin. Agents do NOT commit; the founder commits manually or via a scheduled cron run by Janitor's nightly sweep. **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — git init is one line in `provision-tenant.sh`; commit cadence can be decided in Week 1.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:607:- compiled/ entity pages — searched by `search-by-name` (trigram) and `search-by-attribute` (JSONB GIN). Embedding compiled/ pages is v1.1+ if reflect.ts wants semantic dedup.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:709:- t=0+50ms: Janitor calls `update-entity(candidate_sarah_bowen, "right_to_work_status", "verified")`. Blocks on the flock.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:711:- t=0+301ms: Janitor acquires flock. Reads file (now contains Concierge's append). Reads Postgres (`updated_at = T1`). Computes new frontmatter. Writes file atomically. Postgres UPDATE `WHERE updated_at = T1` succeeds (`updated_at = T2`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:727:**Spec gap 2.6:** none of this is in the master brief. **Recommended resolution:** adopt the mechanism above verbatim; document in a `docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` companion file in Week 1 (before agent code starts). **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — concurrency code is a v1.0 build artefact, not a Week 0 prerequisite, but the design needs to land before the first multi-agent test in week 5.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:751:v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic (no vault writes; sales-only), Janitor (heavy writes — nightly batch of thousands of Bullhorn entity updates), Scribe (per-call writes; ~30-60 min/day per consultant per Product Spec §2.2 R6), Cash Conductor (writes Placement updates on invoice events; reads heavily for invoice context), Sourcing Scout (read-heavy; produces drafts that the agent itself writes elsewhere), Concierge (per-lifecycle-event writes; reads candidate state on every inbound).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:761:- `ingest-entity` — Janitor's nightly sweep ingests thousands of records; batching is the model. Per-record latency 100ms-1s is fine.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:775:| Janitor | 1:5 | reads each Bullhorn entity once; writes many cleanup updates per sweep |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:778:**Peak concurrent agents per tenant (v1.0):** 4-5 — Janitor (nightly batch but daytime cleanup tasks too), Scribe (webhook-driven per-call), Cash Conductor (always-on watcher), Sourcing Scout (request-response), Concierge (always-on). At Boutique-tier these all run in one PM2 process group per tenant; at Scale-tier the same.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:836:Concurrency mechanisms from §2.6 (`flock`, optimistic concurrency, debounce, escalation codes) live in `wiki/lib/concurrency.ts`. Each operation's CLI handler calls into the library, which handles the locking + Postgres + audit logging. Escalation codes flow via existing cortextOS escalation router pattern (write to inbox as system message). Every wrapper writes `hh_decision_trigger` / `hh_decision_output` rows per master brief §8.1 Change 2.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:893:| **Consistency with cortextOS bus convention** | Identical pattern: 47 existing bus wrappers under `packages/harness/cortextos/bus/` all do `exec node dist/cli.js bus <command>`. Option α uses the same 3-line shim shape. Zero cognitive tax for an engineer who already understands cortextOS. | New surface (MCP). Aligns with the vertical-adapter pattern (master brief §3.2) where Bullhorn / Companies House etc. are MCP servers — so consistent with that pattern, not with the bus pattern. | Aligns with cortextOS's skill convention (each template ships `.claude/skills/` with kb / memory / tasks / heartbeat / etc.). Inconsistent with the bus pattern; consistent with the skill pattern; awkward under R2. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:907:2. **Master brief §8 (Agent Bundle v2 pattern + `tools.yaml` contract).** §8.1 specifies the bundle has `tools.yaml` for "MCP servers + scopes + degraded modes" — i.e. external MCP connectors (Bullhorn, Companies House, Xero). The wiki is **internal** to IFOS, not an external execution backend. Treating wiki ops as bus commands (Option α) keeps `tools.yaml` clean of internal-surface declarations; treating them as MCP tools (Option β) conflates internal-data-access with external-tool-invocation in the same `tools.yaml`.

docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:1:# Bullhorn outreach — ready-to-send email drafts
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:3:**Status:** Reference (operations playbook for Bullhorn commercial conversations)
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:5:**Purpose:** Drop-in email drafts the founder sends to Bullhorn partnerships + developer support to resolve Sub-decisions A + B in `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`. Closes Risk #2 mitigation path; unblocks Janitor W5 build gate.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:15:- **Sub-decision B** (OAuth flow specifics): we've verified the structural shape from Bullhorn's public docs (authorization-code + refresh-token; per-tenant `corpToken` and `restUrl`). Need confirmation of specifics: refresh-token TTL behaviour, rate-limit caps, sandbox environment availability.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:17:**These don't block today.** They block **Janitor W5 build** (per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3). You have ~5 weeks of runway. But send today/Monday because Bullhorn's response time is 2-5 business days, and we want the answers before Diagnostic W3-4 completes so Janitor W5 starts unblocked.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:23:## §2 — Submission 1: Bullhorn Partnerships (Sub-decision A)
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:29:This is a Marketo form (`mktoForm_8918`) hosted on Bullhorn's site. Scroll down the page; you'll see a multi-field form with name / company / email / phone / message. Fill that out. It routes internally to Bullhorn's partnerships team.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:42:> Hi Bullhorn Partnerships team,
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:44:> I'm Maddox Rigby, founder of Intel Force Ltd (UK). We're building Intel Force OS — an AI agent fleet for UK recruitment agencies that integrates with Bullhorn as the primary ATS. Three of our six v1.0 agents (Janitor for nightly data cleanup, Scribe for post-call structured write-back, Concierge for lifecycle event triggers) will read and write to Bullhorn on behalf of pilot tenants.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:49:> Is membership in the Marketplace Partner Programme required for production tenants to connect Intel Force OS to their Bullhorn instances? Or can pilot tenants authorise us as a connected app via the standard developer-tier path (support-ticket-issued client_id/client_secret per https://bullhorn.github.io/Getting-Started-with-REST)?
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:74:- If they require marketplace membership before production access → Sub-decision A is **Marketplace**; need cost + timeline to assess against kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (Janitor W5 deadline).
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:75:- If they offer a Bullhorn Developer Program intermediate tier → that's likely the right path for 2026 H2 pilots; defer marketplace to v1.1+.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:80:## §3 — Email 2: Bullhorn Developer Support (Sub-decision B)
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:82:**Don't send this independently.** Bullhorn's developer portal at `developer.bullhorn.com` is docs-only — no contact form. The "Bullhorn Resource Center" mentioned in their docs is customer-only (we're not a customer yet). The pragmatic path:
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:89:If partnerships doesn't engage within 2 weeks, fallback: submit via the main corporate contact form at `https://www.bullhorn.com/contact-us/` with "Developer integration enquiry" in the message body, OR LinkedIn outreach to a Bullhorn developer advocate.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:93:> Hi Bullhorn Developer Support,
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:97:> Our architecture: per-tenant OAuth (authorization-code grant) with refresh-token rotation. Each pilot tenant authorises Intel Force OS as a connected app via Bullhorn's standard OAuth flow. We store the refresh_token per-tenant, exchange it for access_tokens + BhRestToken on demand.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:102:> What is the documented refresh-token TTL? When a refresh_token is exchanged for a new access_token, does the refresh_token itself rotate (single-use) or remain valid (long-lived)? Our connector polls Bullhorn every 5 minutes per pilot tenant — we need to plan for graceful refresh-token renewal under that cadence.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:105:> If two parallel processes for the same pilot tenant attempt token refresh concurrently (race condition), what's the expected server behaviour? Does Bullhorn invalidate the older refresh_token on a successful exchange, or accept both?
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:108:> Is there a sandbox / staging Bullhorn environment we can use for development without consuming production-tier API budget? If yes, what's the access path (separate credentials, sandbox-only client_id, or in-production with a "test corpToken")?
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:111:> Does Bullhorn's OAuth 2.0 implementation support the client_credentials grant type for service-account-style access (against our own developer-tier tenant, not pilot tenants)? We want to use this for IFOS-internal CI testing and connector unit-test fixtures. The public docs reference only authorization-code grant.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:130:- Sandbox available → use it for CI tests + W5 build. Save credentials to your local 1Password as "IFOS Bullhorn Dev sandbox".
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:141:2. **Tell Claude:** "Bullhorn partnerships responded — saved at `docs/operations/bullhorn-partnerships-response-2026-05-XX.md`"
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:147:## §5 — If Bullhorn doesn't respond within a week
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:151:2. **Monday 2026-06-01** — second nudge with explicit deadline reference ("we're targeting Janitor build W5; need clarity by then")
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:152:3. **Wednesday 2026-06-03** — LinkedIn outreach to a named Bullhorn employee in partnerships or developer relations. Search "Bullhorn partnerships" or "Bullhorn developer advocacy" on LinkedIn; aim for a UK-based person if available.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:160:**Reference.** Two drop-in email drafts ready for founder to send. Expected wall-clock: 1 week for both responses. Outcome: Sub-decisions A + B flip Accepted; Risk #2 mitigated; Janitor W5 build unblocked.

agents/recruitment/concierge/README.md:20:- `tools.yaml` — Bullhorn R+W + Microsoft Graph + Gmail + voice classifier + autosend bridge (per D1 outcome)
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:3:**Status:** Proposed (Day-19 pre-W10-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Microsoft Graph / Gmail per-tenant signup + Founder Decision D1 autosend orange-tier path + W10 build slice).
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Drafts are orange-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` — consultant approval required before send via the autosend-bridge mechanism (Founder Decision D1 path A bridge OR D1-B shim OR D1-C manual; W10 design selects). Sends route via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; AgentMail deferred to v1.1+). Gate A hard-fails any draft generated >30 minutes after lifecycle event, any draft with voice classifier <0.75, or any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). Gate B success threshold: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:159:1. **Autosend tier contradiction internal to artefact:** §1 says all Bullhorn writes yellow-tier; §3.Output 2 mapped tacit-note to `bullhorn_candidate_tag` which is GREEN. Internal §1/§3/§4 inconsistency.

docs/decisions/2026-05-18-day-7-single-sentence-test.md:143:- Q1 = YES, Q3 = NO (accepted) → Week 0 closes by founder discretion; Week 1 starts with Risk #2 elevated; Diagnostic W3-4 begins under accepted risk; Janitor W5 contingent on Q3 clearing by then.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:115:3. **`agents/_shared/{voice-loader,hook-helpers}.sh`** per master brief §8.1 Change 1 + Change 2. The wiki library invokes `hh_decision_*` from `hook-helpers.sh` for every operation; `voice-loader.sh` calls `wiki/lib/search.ts` against `voice_samples_embedded`. Lands Week 1-2.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:14:> The document claims Week-1 implementation can proceed before the auth path is cleared. Lines 57-72 list commercial blockers for Sub-decisions A/B, but line 95 says those can remain Proposed without blocking Week-1 implementation. That weakens the Day-7 auth-path quality gate. Fix by making Bullhorn connector scaffolding explicitly conditional on A/B resolution or by narrowing Week-1 work to non-auth code only.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:20:**Counter:** Codex is applying the Day-7 single-sentence-test Q3 quality gate ("ATS decided + auth cleared") as if it were a Week-1 implementation gate. The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:29:**None of these reference Bullhorn at all.** They are tenant-agnostic + adapter-agnostic substrate. Sub-decisions A+B remaining Proposed (commercial questions about marketplace partnership + dev tenant access) does not block these.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:31:Specifically: per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1 line 96, Diagnostic (the first agent build, W3-4) is explicitly "no Bullhorn; Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY)." Per ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1, Diagnostic's MCP tools are "Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages" — no Bullhorn. **Diagnostic W3-4 build does not touch the Bullhorn auth path at all.**
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:33:The first agent that touches Bullhorn is **Janitor (W5)** per master brief §8.2 row 2. The Q3 gate IS load-bearing for Janitor — Sub-decisions A+B MUST flip to Accepted before Janitor build starts. The kill-criterion `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5) explicitly fires PIVOT if auth fails by end of W5; this is the formal gate.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:41:| Diagnostic build (W3-4) | None — Diagnostic doesn't touch Bullhorn | Awaits Q1 LOI |

Forces all 5 Week-1 prereq commits to be re-classified as W5-prereq. Operationally complex + arguably wrong (renderer doesn't need Bullhorn auth to render).
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:82:- **Split the difference** — line 95 wording sharpens AND a new explicit "Week-1 prereq vs W5 agent-build gate hierarchy" subsection is added to bullhorn-integration-path.md §1.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:34:- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:42:**Weeks 5-13 planning is speculative without §B.** Each agent's prerequisites (Bullhorn MCP, Fathom/Fireflies, Xero, LinkedIn) have lead times. Bullhorn MCP work itself starts Week 1 per Ultraplan §9 line 724 ("Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it"). Without knowing the agent build order, those infrastructure prereqs can't be sequenced.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:44:**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:50:Six criteria to evaluate each agent against in §2. Each criterion scored High / Medium / Low or with a concrete number; substantive cells in §2 must justify the score by reference to master brief / Ultraplan / Product Spec / Day-2 Bullhorn decision.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:55:| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:56:| 3 | **Risk de-risking** | Which named risks the agent's success/failure surfaces — Risk #1 (cortextOS primitives), Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth), Risk #5 (renderer-not-built) — per `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` | Building risk-surfacing agents earlier converts known-unknowns into known-knowns; building risk-deferring agents earlier preserves optionality but pushes the surprise window later |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:182:W5:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:198:- Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps surface only at Concierge W10-13 (Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 caveat).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:200:**Cost if deferred risk materialises late:** if Bullhorn webhook coverage is worse than expected (Risk #2 secondary), Concierge polling cadence increases (per Day 2 §4.2 fallback) — connector-internal change, no agent rework. Bounded.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:202:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Excellent.** Cash Conductor at W7-8 matches Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim. Hire #1 (assumed W7) takes Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work as first sprint — well-scoped, independent of the Bullhorn track founder has been driving solo W3-W6.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:208:W5-8: Concierge (A6) — front-load the flagship (XL/4 weeks)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:209:W9:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:253:| 2. Substrate exercise (sequential build-up) | **Wins** — each agent extends the substrate of the prior (renderer → Bullhorn auth → voice → Tier-1 primitives → multi-source → full Tier-1 lifecycle) | Loses — Concierge has to build its own Bullhorn auth + voice substrate inline | Loses — Concierge built before its substrate dependencies (Scribe's Notes-for-context not yet available) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |

Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:282:| 2 | W5 | **Janitor** (A2) | First Bullhorn auth + downstream-pattern-setter (Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge inherit) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:300:**Trigger 1 — Risk #2 materialises in Week 4-5.** If Bullhorn auth path breaks (Day 2 Sub-decisions A or B don't flip to Accepted, marketplace required but unobtainable, OAuth flow blocks deployment, or per-tenant client_id ticket cycle slows past 5 business days per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 row 5):
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:314:**Trigger 3 — Hire #1 starts later than Week 7.** Per Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim caveat: "Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)":

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:408:First exercise is Janitor at W5 per §4.1 row 2. **If Day 2 Sub-decisions A and B haven't flipped from Proposed to Accepted by start of W4** (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 commercial-blocker table), this is the natural blocker. Founder Sunday/Monday commercial conversations must land before W4 start to keep the Janitor W5 slot intact. Sub-decision C is already Accepted so the endpoint surface is buildable; the gate is auth path (A) and client_credentials foreclosure (B).

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:490:| Sequencing target | §4.1 | Master brief §8.2 sequence ratified verbatim: Diagnostic W3-4 → Janitor W5 → Scribe W6 → Cash Conductor W7-8 → Sourcing Scout W9 → Concierge W10-13 |

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:33:- **ATS pivot:** Bullhorn-first → Vincere-first, Voyager Infinity-first, or vertical-without-ATS
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:73:### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:75:**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:81:**Action:** PIVOT state. Rescope from Bullhorn-first to alternate ATS-first:
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:83:- **Option A:** Vincere-first. Mid-market UK recruitment ATS; smaller market than Bullhorn but more accessible API.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:85:- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:128:- Bullhorn API call at <£0.001 per action (free tier)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:158:### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:227:- **Trigger 8 (Gate-B revenue) KILL:** founder decides KILL on revenue evidence; consults Jack on wind-down terms with existing pilots before 30-day notice goes out.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:334:- The agent fleet of 6 named in master brief §8.2 (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:339:- The ATS assumption: Bullhorn-first per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Sub-decision C
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:375:**For Week 3-13 (v1.0 build).** Every agent build references this kill criterion. Diagnostic (W3-4) faces Trigger 2; Janitor (W5) faces Trigger 3; all agents from W3 onward face Triggers 5, 6, 9. The kill criterion is the operational definition of "are we still on-track" at each weekly review.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:1:# Bullhorn integration path — decision document
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:6:**Surfaced by:** Master brief §6 Day 2 (lines 466-467) — "Decision: Bullhorn Marketplace vs Direct API. OAuth model: browser dance for production, service-account for dev." Plus Ultraplan §11 Day 2 (lines 847-849).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:19:**Sub-decision A — Bullhorn integration path.** Marketplace partner programme membership (with its access tier, scope, certification, ongoing fees) versus direct API access (per-tenant Bullhorn-account-admin authorisation of IFOS as a connected app). Master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 explicitly names this as the day's decision. The path chosen determines whether `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/` ships as a marketplace-registered connector or a direct-API connector — the *code* in either case is similar OAuth + REST plumbing, but the *operational, commercial, and rate-limit* surfaces differ materially.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:21:**Sub-decision B — OAuth flow.** Master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 pre-states a recommendation: "browser dance for production, service-account for dev." This is the authorization-code grant (per-tenant browser dance, refresh-token cycle) for production tenants, plus client-credentials grant (service account) for IFOS-internal sandbox/dev work. Sub-decision B verifies that recommendation against Bullhorn's actual OAuth implementation and pins the per-tenant token storage path (per `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution: `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`, mode `0600`).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:23:**Sub-decision C — v1.0 endpoint surface.** Which Bullhorn endpoints each of the v1.0 agents (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge — see §1.2) reads and writes, the cadence (real-time webhook vs scheduled poll vs ad-hoc request-response), and the rate-limit budget allocation. Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:27:Master brief §12 Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) — "Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week" — names this as one of the four risks that could kill v1.0. Tripwire: "End of week 3 status not 'core read endpoints working'" (master brief §12 row #2, Ultraplan §10 row #2). The mitigation is "Week 0 Day 2 on Bullhorn auth research" — i.e. this document. Without Sub-decisions A and B answered, Week 1 cannot begin scaffolding `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/` because the connector's authentication path determines its scope and shape.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:29:**Bullhorn dependency count for v1.0 agents:**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:31:| Agent | Bullhorn dependency in v1.0 | Source |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:34:| A2 Janitor | **Yes — read + write** (nightly cleanup sweep) | Master brief §8.2 line 602; Ultraplan §8.1 A2 line 507-510 |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:36:| A4 Cash Conductor | No direct Bullhorn (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage + Open Banking) | Ultraplan §8.1 A4 line 533-537 |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:40:**Four of six v1.0 agents directly touch Bullhorn.** The two that don't (Diagnostic, Cash Conductor) have independent paths. So Bullhorn integration timing gates ~67% of the v1.0 agent build. Per Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency wording: "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1" — that is the documented v1.0-scope cut if Bullhorn slips.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:42:This is also the Day 2 critical-path artefact for the §6 Day 7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 lines 494-502, Ultraplan §12 lines 887-895), question 3: "Have we decided which ATS we're building against first (Bullhorn) and have we cleared the auth path?" A Yes answer requires this document plus the Sub-decision A and B confirmations to land before Sunday review.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:48:**Technically grounded (Claude Code can analyse tonight from Bullhorn public documentation + master brief / Ultraplan / product spec context):**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:50:- The structural shape of Bullhorn's OAuth flows (authorization code vs client credentials) and which scenarios each is suited to.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:52:- Token lifecycle outline: short-lived REST sessions, long-lived refresh tokens, periodic re-auth dance via the Bullhorn login URL.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:59:- Whether Intel Force Ltd is currently a member of the **Bullhorn Marketplace Partner Programme** (or what the application timeline + cost would be). The marketplace partner application process is publicly known to involve a technical review, security audit, and ongoing partner fees — but the specifics for IFOS's tier and tenant volume are commercial-confidential and need a direct conversation.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:60:- Whether **marketplace-tier API access differs from direct-API access** in rate limits, available scopes (e.g. write to JobOrder, write to Note, webhook subscription), or sandbox availability. Bullhorn's public docs are sparse on the deltas; partner reps know the actuals.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:62:- **What ATS the first design partner uses.** If the first signed pilot is on Vincere or Voyager Infinity instead of Bullhorn, Sub-decision C's endpoint surface (and the Janitor / Concierge build order) needs revisiting per master brief §6 Day 2 Sub-decision and Ultraplan §9.1 sequencing.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:74:The Sunday design-partner conversation 2 is the most time-sensitive: it can flip the entire premise of Sub-decisions A and C. Founder cadence per master brief §6 Day 2 (line 467) and §11.2 line 791 ("Day 2 — Tuesday — Bullhorn integration path... — Design-partner conversation 2") puts this as a parallel-to-Claude-Code track.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:111:### 2.1 — Bullhorn marketplace partner programme
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:113:Bullhorn's public surfaces for the partner programme are deliberately thin. Three URLs surveyed Day 2 (2026-05-16 evening):
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:116:- `https://www.bullhorn.com/become-a-partner/` — landing page. Main CTA: **"Fill out the form to learn more about our partner programs."** References three external resources (FAQs, Bullhorn Developer Program, Fair Use Policy) but the page itself contains **no specific information** on application process, tiers, certification, security review, fees, ongoing costs, or timeline. The only substantive description on the page is: **"The Bullhorn Marketplace gives our customers the choice, confidence, and customization they need to innovate with agility."**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:122:- Bullhorn Marketplace currently lists 300+ partner integrations (the headline number on the marketplace page).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:123:- There is a separately-named **Bullhorn Developer Program** distinct from the Marketplace partner programme (linked from `/become-a-partner/`) — implying a possible two-tier structure: developer-tier access to APIs (lighter) vs marketplace-listed partner (heavier).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:136:**Inference (clearly marked as inference, not Bullhorn's stated position):** the gap between "free developer account" and "marketplace-listed partner" is structurally common across enterprise SaaS platforms (Salesforce AppExchange, HubSpot Marketplace, ServiceNow Store all follow this pattern). The plausible IFOS path through this commercial space is: register for the Bullhorn Developer Program first (which usually grants API access for a tenant the developer controls or for sandbox dev), then apply for marketplace listing once an integration is shippable. Whether either path is required for IFOS production tenants — the actual gate — is the §1.3 partnerships@bullhorn conversation.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:138:### 2.2 — Direct Bullhorn API access
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:143:- `https://bullhorn.github.io/docs` — Bullhorn's developer documentation landing. Names three API surfaces: REST API, OAuth, SOAP (legacy). The REST and OAuth links are the operative ones for v1.0.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:145:**The technical model verified from Bullhorn's "Getting Started with REST" documentation (cited inline below):**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:148:- **`BhRestToken` (REST session token)** is presented on each subsequent REST call in three accepted forms: URL query parameter, HTTP header (`BhRestToken` or `BHRestToken`), or cookie. On expiry, REST calls return 401 — application must re-run /login. (Bullhorn doc verbatim: "When the current session key expires, your query will return a 401 response.")
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:150:- **client_id / client_secret acquisition.** Bullhorn doc verbatim: **"Bullhorn customers can obtain OAuth keys for developing applications...by creating a support ticket via the Bullhorn Resource Center."** This is not a self-service developer signup — there is a Bullhorn-side gate even for the developer-tier path. Implication: every IFOS pilot tenant must open a support ticket with Bullhorn to authorise IFOS as a connected app, or IFOS must hold a single set of client credentials at the IFOS-application level and route per-tenant auth through it. The structural distinction here is exactly what Sub-decision A pivots on — partnerships@bullhorn confirms whether marketplace status grants application-level credentials.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:151:- **Documented rate limit signal:** Bullhorn's REST docs name **HTTP 429** as "Rate Limited — Wait 1 second then retry request. Repeat until successful." That's the only rate-limit reference in the public docs surveyed; specifics (per-second/minute/day caps, per-corpToken or per-application) are not documented and are commercially gated to verification per §1.3.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:166:| Time-to-first-call (greenlight → working API call against a tenant) | **CG.** Inference: marketplace certification + security review typically 4-12 weeks for enterprise SaaS programmes of this maturity. Bullhorn-specific timeline not stated publicly. | **CG.** Confirmed from public docs: customer raises Bullhorn support ticket per /Getting-Started-with-REST to obtain client_id/client_secret. ETA per ticket cycle — likely 1-5 business days per pilot tenant. |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:167:| Per-tenant onboarding friction (admin auth, scope review) | **CG.** If marketplace tier grants IFOS application-level credentials, per-tenant friction may reduce to "tenant clicks Authorise from marketplace listing." | Each pilot tenant raises a Bullhorn support ticket + tenant admin authorises IFOS as a connected app via per-tenant OAuth screen. Per-tenant friction: 1 support ticket + 1 OAuth dance per pilot tenant. |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:168:| Co-marketing benefit | Listed in the 300+ partner directory on bullhorn.com/marketplace; potentially Bullhorn-sales-rep co-selling motion. **CG** on specific benefit terms. | None. |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:169:| Cost at 3-tenant pilot scale (2026 H2, Boutique tier per Product Spec §3.1) | **CG.** Public docs do not name partner fees. Inference based on comparable enterprise SaaS marketplace programmes: annual partner fee typically $5K-$25K + possibly per-listing or per-referral revenue-share. | **CG.** Public docs do not name developer-program fees. Inference: likely zero or nominal for the developer-tier API access. Per-tenant cost zero — the tenant pays Bullhorn, IFOS pays nothing per call. |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:170:| Cost at 100-tenant target scale (Product Spec §5.4 end-2027 target) | **CG.** May or may not scale linearly with tenant count. Some marketplace programmes have flat annual fees; others meter on tenant or revenue volume. | **CG.** If developer-tier cost is zero or nominal, scales fine. Risk: per-tenant Bullhorn support tickets at 100 tenants become operational drag at IFOS-Customer-Success layer (Product Spec §5.4 line 373 names ≤8 hours of human time per customer onboarding — Bullhorn ticket may consume a meaningful fraction). |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:172:| Founder operational overhead (per tenant + ongoing) | **CG.** If marketplace handles per-tenant auth: low per-tenant overhead. Annual partner-programme obligations: technical review responses, security questionnaire renewals, marketplace listing maintenance — non-trivial ongoing. | Per-tenant: one Bullhorn support ticket request from the tenant admin per pilot. Ongoing: zero programme obligations; only IFOS-side OAuth token refresh management. |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:179:**Recommendation: scaffold the Bullhorn MCP connector against direct API / Developer Program for v1.0 weeks 1-2; treat marketplace registration as a v1.1+ commercial track that the connector's auth module is designed to swap into without endpoint-surface changes.**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:183:1. **The §1.4 honest-signal fallback architecture demands it.** With Bullhorn commercial answers slow-rolling (likely Monday at earliest, possibly later), Week 1 connector scaffolding cannot block on partnerships@bullhorn responses. Scaffolding against the documented direct-API auth flow lets the connector progress; the §2.3 Switching-cost analysis shows the auth-module swap is bounded.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:184:2. **Direct API access is technically sufficient for v1.0.** The public REST API documentation surveyed (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) names no entity-level scope gating for marketplace-tier vs direct-tier. The endpoint surface required by the four Bullhorn-touching v1.0 agents (Janitor R+W, Scribe W, Sourcing Scout R, Concierge R+W per §1.2) is fully addressable via documented direct-API REST endpoints — barring a commercially-gated discovery in §1.3 conversation that contradicts this.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:191:| Marketplace tier is **required** for production tenant onboarding (partnerships@bullhorn answer) | Connector scaffolds against direct-API on a Bullhorn-sandbox tenant for IFOS internal dev; marketplace registration becomes Week-1 critical-path commercial work; v1.0 build slips by the marketplace certification timeline (potentially 4-12 weeks per §2.3 row 1 inference). This is a v1.0 blocker scenario and feeds master brief §12 Risk #2 directly. |

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:196:**Status: Proposed.** Status flips to Accepted on either: (a) partnerships@bullhorn confirms marketplace is not required for v1.0 production tenant access AND first design partner uses Bullhorn; OR (b) founder explicitly accepts the documented fallback if marketplace turns out required, and re-cuts the v1.0 timeline to absorb the marketplace certification window.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:204:The flow Bullhorn documents at `https://bullhorn.github.io/Getting-Started-with-REST`. Verified specifics:
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:210:The `{loginInfo}` placeholder is per-tenant-cluster — IFOS resolves it via the Bullhorn `loginInfo` lookup endpoint before kicking off OAuth. This is part of the connector's auth module.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:213:1. Per-tenant Bullhorn admin (or IFOS-on-behalf-of-admin if marketplace path enables it) hits the authorise URL with `client_id`, `response_type=code`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, and per-Bullhorn-docs the `username` + `password` query parameters as well (Bullhorn-specific: their authorize endpoint accepts credentials inline rather than a separate consent screen).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:214:2. Bullhorn returns auth code to `redirect_uri`.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:218:**Token TTLs (Bullhorn doc verbatim):**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:226:**Scope of permissions requested at first auth:** Bullhorn's OAuth docs surveyed do not specify per-scope strings (e.g. `read:candidate`, `write:note`). REST API access appears to be at-tenant-admin-discretion — the admin authorises the connected app for "API access" generally, and the corpToken-scoped session inherits whatever entity permissions the admin's account holds. **Spec gap §3.1-B:** confirm with Bullhorn developer support that there is no per-entity-type scope granularity at the OAuth layer — i.e. IFOS cannot request "read-only" auth and get a token that can't write. If this is correct, then Gate A in `validate.sh` (per master brief §1 Rule 4) becomes the only enforcement layer for "this agent should never write" — the OAuth token itself does not protect.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:230:- Revoked token (tenant admin revokes IFOS access in Bullhorn admin UI) — REST calls return 401 indefinitely; IFOS catches, sends `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` escalation per master brief §8.1 Change 3 line 587 vocabulary.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:232:- Bullhorn account suspended/cancelled — same 401 pathway; escalation routes to founder for tenant-relationship handling.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:233:- Scope change by Bullhorn — unlikely without notice but possible; IFOS connector logs and escalates.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:237:**Bullhorn does NOT document a client_credentials grant in their OAuth specification.** Specifically verified at `https://bullhorn.github.io/Getting-Started-with-REST` — the grant types section names only the authorization-code flow. Inference from this absence (not contradicted by other surveyed docs): Bullhorn does not support client_credentials grant for tenant-scoped data access.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:241:- **IFOS holds a Bullhorn dev tenant** (separate from any production pilot) where IFOS performs authorization-code grant once against IFOS-internal admin credentials; the resulting access/refresh tokens serve as the "dev account" auth state. Tokens still rotate per §3.1; IFOS internal-dev tooling refreshes them.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:242:- **Bullhorn sandbox tier** (if it exists — §2.2 noted sandbox availability is not publicly documented and is commercially gated). If Bullhorn offers a sandbox, the auth model against it is presumed identical to production: authorization-code grant. Just a different `loginInfo` cluster.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:244:**Spec gap §3.2-A:** confirm with Bullhorn developer support whether (a) client_credentials is genuinely unsupported, or (b) it exists for specific partner-tier use cases not documented publicly. If (b), this changes the dev-loop ergonomics. Mark as **CG**.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:251:- **IFOS internal dev / sandbox:** authorization-code grant against IFOS-owned Bullhorn dev tenant (or against Bullhorn sandbox if §3.2-A resolves favourably). Same flow as production; the only difference is the source tenant. Tokens stored at `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/.dev-tokens/` (gitignored) for IFOS dev work.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:256:**Recommendation:** authorization-code grant for production tenants (matches master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 pre-statement "browser dance for production"). For IFOS dev: authorization-code grant against an IFOS-owned Bullhorn dev tenant; service-account / client_credentials grant deferred (because Bullhorn doesn't document support for it per §3.2).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:260:1. **It's the only documented Bullhorn-supported production OAuth path.** Section 3.1's verified Bullhorn documentation grounds this; Section 3.2's documented absence of client_credentials closes the alternative.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:264:**Commercial verification gates** (per §1.3 table, Bullhorn developer support row):
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:266:- Confirm authorization-code grant is the correct production path (i.e. Bullhorn doesn't have a marketplace-tier-only managed-auth path that bypasses the browser dance).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:267:- Confirm Bullhorn sandbox availability and auth model (Spec gap §3.2-A).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:269:- Confirm refresh-token rotation atomicity requirements (any Bullhorn-side timeouts that affect persistence windows).

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:292:**Spec gap §4.1-A:** master brief §8.2 does not enumerate Bullhorn entity types per agent — the master-brief column "Key dependency" names "Bullhorn MCP (R+W)" without specifying which entities. This table is the proposed default; verify against actual Bullhorn data shapes during the Week 3-4 Janitor build and revise if needed.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:298:**Confirmed from Bullhorn public docs:** `https://bullhorn.github.io/rest-api-docs/` describes **no webhook, subscription, event-stream, or push-notification mechanism**. Operations covered: entity CRUD, query/search, file attachments, resume parsing, mass updates, entity metadata. Verified 2026-05-16.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:300:**Implication:** Bullhorn's public-tier REST API is **pull-only**. IFOS must poll for change detection at v1.0 unless commercial verification reveals a partner-tier event-subscription mechanism. **Commercially gated: §4.2-A** — confirm with Bullhorn developer support whether webhook/event-subscription capabilities exist at marketplace/partner tier that are not documented in the public REST docs.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:306:| Janitor Candidate sweep | Polling (full-table scan per sweep) | Nightly 02:00 | Initial sweep is bounded by per-tenant Candidate count; subsequent sweeps use `dateLastModified` filter to limit to changes-since-last-sweep |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:307:| Janitor Note / ClientCorporation / JobOrder sweep | Polling | Nightly 02:00 | Same `dateLastModified` filter pattern |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:308:| Scribe transcript-to-Note write | Push from Fathom/Fireflies → IFOS → REST write to Bullhorn | Per-call (within 5-min SLA) | The Fathom/Fireflies webhook is the trigger; Bullhorn side is REST POST |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:310:| Concierge lifecycle-state monitoring | **Polling fallback** in v1.0 (5-minute cycle) | 5-minute polling | Per Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 gotcha: "Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks." Documented v1.0 plan: polling-primary, webhook-additive when available at marketplace tier. The 5-minute cycle is the conservative v1.0 default; revisit if rate-limit budget permits faster |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:311:| Concierge time-based nurture cadence | Cron (week-1, month-1, month-3, month-6, month-12, month-24) | Per Placement-creation anchor date | No Bullhorn webhook needed — IFOS-side cron fires; IFOS reads Bullhorn for current state then writes the comm Note back |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:324:- **Postgres `decision_log` RLS:** every Bullhorn-derived `hh_decision_*` row is tenant-scoped per ADR-002 Decision 3 (`tenant_slug` column + RLS policy per `second-brain-design.md` §2.4.2).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:328:Bullhorn public docs name HTTP 429 + "wait 1 second then retry" per §2.2; specific per-second / per-minute / per-day caps **commercially gated to verification per §1.3** (Bullhorn dev support).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:330:**Conservative v1.0 budget allocation per tenant per hour** (anchored to typical enterprise REST API patterns of 100-500 req/min ceilings; revise once Bullhorn confirms):
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:334:| Janitor (nightly sweep) | 200-400 during active sweep window (concentrated 1-2 hour burst) | Burst-tolerant; bounded by tenant Candidate-count and `dateLastModified` filter efficiency |
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:342:**Spec gap §4.4-A:** confirm actual Bullhorn rate limits per tenant during commercial conversation per §1.3 table (Bullhorn dev support row). Revise this budget table when actuals land.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:346:**Emerged from §3.1 finding:** Bullhorn's 10-minute access token TTL is short enough that v1.0 needs an explicit refresh-loop pattern. Lazy refresh on 401 alone is insufficient for two reasons: (a) it would cause every 10-minute window's first call to take a refresh round-trip's worth of latency, breaking sub-second SLAs on Concierge real-time paths; (b) 401 detection on burst writes (Scribe's per-call sequence of 5-15 REST writes) means burst-mid-flight refresh failures lose write ordering.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:353:  - Second failure: emit `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` per master brief §8.1 Change 3 line 587; pause Bullhorn-touching operations; agent enters degraded mode per Ultraplan §3.5 line 110 ("drafts-only, no auto-send, scheduled retry"); founder Telegram notification.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:356:- **`BhRestToken` cache invalidation:** when access token refreshes, the `BhRestToken` is independently maintained (it persists across access-token refreshes per Bullhorn's two-step model). On 401 from a REST call, IFOS re-runs `/login` to get a new `BhRestToken` without needing to re-OAuth.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:357:- **State location:** refresh-loop is a goroutine-equivalent (Node `setInterval` or similar) inside the Bullhorn MCP connector process, per-tenant scoped. Multiple agents on the same tenant share the connector's token cache.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:369:Recommendation: scaffold the Bullhorn MCP connector against direct API / Developer Program for v1.0 weeks 1-2; treat marketplace registration as a v1.1+ commercial track that the connector's auth module is designed to swap into without endpoint-surface changes (per §2.4 + §1.4 fallback architecture).

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:419:Concierge's write capability to Bullhorn (Note auto-send, status updates per §4.1) interacts with Day 5's auto-send safety policy artefact. Day 5 should reference this document's §4.1 Concierge row for the specific entities Concierge will be writing — Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:423:Bullhorn entity field mapping (Candidate, JobOrder, Placement, Note, ClientCorporation) → IFOS wiki schema per `second-brain-design.md` §2.2 entity types. Out of scope for this Day-2 decision; flagged for Week 11-13 work. Concrete handoff: §4.1's per-agent read-entity list is the v1.0 minimum set the wiki ingest paths must handle.

   425	      - Brief is the most-read entity by Sourcing Scout (matches against candidates) and Concierge (lifecycle communications reference active brief). Janitor sweeps for status drift.
   426	      - v0.1 skills as free strings; v1.1 introduces a canonical skill taxonomy (out of scope here; ADR-006 candidate).

     1	# IFOS escalation codes catalogue
     2	
     3	**Status:** Reference — single source of truth for `ESC_*` codes used by any agent. Wired into `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (Phase 3).
     4	**Mandated by:** master brief §8.1 Change 3 — "Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one."
     5	**Update protocol:** new codes added here BEFORE wiring into helpers + before referencing from any agent bundle. Code names are case-sensitive; pattern `ESC_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`.
     6	
     7	---
     8	
     9	## §1 — How escalation codes work
    10	
    11	Every `ESC_*` is a payload written to Postgres `decision_log` (per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + Day-4 §6.3 schema) plus a Telegram notification to the operator (per master brief §2.4 primitive 5 + `common-notifications.json` routing).
    12	
    13	The payload template established by `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4 + ratified in `autosend-safety-policy.md` §5:
    14	
    15	```
    16	agent_name        — the agent firing the escalation (or '_renderer')
    17	tenant_slug       — RLS-isolated per tenant
    18	phase             — one of {trigger, output, action, gating_failed, agent_handoff}; per decision_log CHECK constraint at Day-4 §6.3
    19	human_action      — the ESC_* code itself + optional `:reason` suffix
    20	payload           — JSON object: {tier?, action_type?, target?, payload_hash?, reason, ...code-specific fields}
    21	created_at        — `now()` at insertion
    22	```
    23	
    24	The Telegram message is templated via `common-notifications.json` `escalation_routes.<ESC_CODE>` if present; otherwise routed to `operator_chat_id`. `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED` additionally CCs `ifos_oncall_chat_id`.

    32	
    33	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`
    34	- **Severity:** info → blocking-pending-approval
    35	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action queued for tenant operator review
    36	- **Phase:** `action`
    37	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` via Telegram approval gate (primitive 4)
    38	- **Timeout:** 4h default per `common-notifications.json.default_approval_timeout_seconds`; on timeout, converts to manual reconciliation
    39	- **Payload fields:** `tier`, `action_type`, `target`, `payload_hash`, `payload_preview`, `approval_status='pending'`
    40	
    41	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`
    42	- **Severity:** warn (informational; no human action needed)
    43	- **Trigger:** Red-tier action attempted; refused entirely (red is the tier-override floor per autosend §8)
    44	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    45	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; informational only
    46	- **Payload fields:** `tier='red'`, `action_type`, `target`, `payload_hash`, `reason='red_tier_classification'`
    47	
    48	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`
    49	- **Severity:** **critical** — operational failure, not a policy decision
    50	- **Trigger:** `autosend_policy_lookup()` could not resolve a tier for the given `action_type` (unknown action_type, malformed `autosend-policy.yaml`, or tenant override resolution failed)
    51	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    52	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` — IFOS oncall must investigate
    53	- **Payload fields:** `tier='fail-safe-red'`, `action_type`, `target`, `reason` (one of `unknown_action_type`, `override_resolution_failed`, `unknown_tier:<value>`)
    54	- **Fail-safe behaviour:** Action refused regardless of declared tier

    56	### 2.2 — Vault concurrency (5 codes)
    57	Source: `docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` §6
    58	
    59	#### `ESC_VAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT`
    60	- **Severity:** warn
    61	- **Trigger:** `flock` acquisition failed within `OP_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S = 5` seconds (per `common-vault.json.lock_timeout_seconds`)
    62	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    63	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    64	- **Payload fields:** `vault_path`, `lock_holder_pid` (if knowable), `wait_duration_ms`
    65	
    66	#### `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`
    67	- **Severity:** warn
    68	- **Trigger:** Postgres optimistic-concurrency UPDATE found 0 rows after `OP_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS = 100` retry (per `common-vault.json.retry_backoff_ms`); per vault-concurrency §3 retry policy
    69	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    70	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    71	- **Payload fields:** `entity_id`, `expected_version`, `actual_version`
    72	
    73	#### `ESC_VAULT_HUMAN_EDIT_BLOCKED`
    74	- **Severity:** warn — likely founder is editing in Obsidian
    75	- **Trigger:** Obsidian debounce hit `MAX_RETRIES = 5` (file mtime still recent after 30s of waiting) per vault-concurrency §4 + `common-vault.json.obsidian_debounce_max_retries`
    76	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    77	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    78	- **Payload fields:** `vault_path`, `file_mtime`, `last_observed_age_ms`
    79	
    80	#### `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_PARTIAL_FAILURE`
    81	- **Severity:** warn — requires founder manual reconciliation
    82	- **Trigger:** Rewrite-backlinks cascade completed but ≥1 referencing entity failed to rewrite per vault-concurrency §5.4 v1.0 mitigation
    83	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    84	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    85	- **Payload fields:** `failures` (list of entity_id strings), `successful_count`, `total_count`
    86	
    87	#### `ESC_VAULT_CASCADE_TIMEOUT`
    88	- **Severity:** warn
    89	- **Trigger:** Cascade exceeded `CASCADE_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` ms per vault-concurrency §5 + `common-vault.json.cascade_timeout_ms`
    90	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
    91	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
    92	- **Payload fields:** `partial_progress_count`, `total_refs_count`
    93	
    94	### 2.3 — Bullhorn integration (1 code)
    95	Source: `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 + §6
    96	
    97	#### `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH`
    98	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent enters degraded mode (drafts-only, no auto-send)
    99	- **Trigger:** Bullhorn OAuth token refresh failed twice on the per-agent 8-minute cycle (per `common-ats.json.auth_refresh_interval_seconds`); or REST call returned 401 indefinitely (revoked token in Bullhorn admin UI)
   100	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   101	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   102	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type` (one of `refresh_failed`, `revoked_401`), `last_attempt_at`, `consecutive_failures`
   103	- **Recovery:** agent stays in degraded mode until founder rotates token via Bullhorn admin → next `_secrets.env` reload picks up new token
   104	
   105	### 2.4 — Renderer (1 code)
   106	Source: `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4
   107	
   108	#### `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED`
   109	- **Severity:** blocking — render did not produce a runnable agent dir
   110	- **Trigger:** Renderer exited non-zero. Mid-render atomic-rename per ADR-003 §3.3.4 means the prior agent dir at target is preserved (`.prev.<timestamp>/`) — no half-rendered state visible to daemon discovery
   111	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   112	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; CC `ifos_oncall_chat_id` only on `atomic-rename-failed` (infrastructure failure, not author error)
   113	- **Agent name:** `_renderer` (sentinel; not a real agent)
   114	- **Payload fields:** `reason` (one of `schema-validation-failure`, `bundle-malformed`, `shared-helpers-missing`, `tenant-not-provisioned`, `atomic-rename-failed`, `non-rendered-target`), `agent_name_attempted`, `tenant_slug_attempted`
   115	- **Codex query:** `SELECT * FROM decision_log WHERE agent_name='_renderer' AND human_action LIKE 'ESC_RENDERER_FAILED%'` per ADR-003 §4.7

   120	#### `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`
   121	- **Severity:** warn
   122	- **Trigger:** Voice classifier score below `common-voice.json.voice_classifier_threshold` (default 0.75) after 3 retries per Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget
   123	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   124	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   125	- **Payload fields:** `final_classifier_score`, `retry_count`, `agent_name`, `task_summary`
   126	
   127	#### `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED`
   128	- **Severity:** warn — Janitor dedup needs human approval

   176	
   177	#### `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL`
   178	- **Severity:** warn
   179	- **Trigger:** Agent rejected its input at the validation gate (e.g. malformed firm name, missing required CLI argument, brief description too short). Detected at Step 1 of the agent's workflow BEFORE any tool calls or LLM invocations
   180	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   181	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`

   212	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   213	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   214	- **Payload fields:** `from_path`, `to_path`, `racing_writer_pid`
   215	
   216	#### `ESC_CORTEXTOS_RESTART_REQUESTED`
   217	- **Severity:** info
   218	- **Trigger:** Agent self-requested restart per primitive 6 (`cortextos-ifos bus self-restart`) — typically post-degraded-mode recovery, post-context-overflow handoff

   484	
   485	### 8.1 v1.0 agents (six)
   486	
   487	#### A1. The Diagnostic — the sales tool
   488	
   489	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 4–5)
   490	- **Always-on?** No — invoked on demand
   491	- **Trigger type:** Manual (run from CLI or sales-tool web page)
   492	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None — runs as a one-shot batch job
   493	- **MCP tools required:** Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages
   494	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (uses Maddox's voice for the audit narrative), decision log writer
   495	- **External APIs:** Companies House API (free), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), basic HTTP fetch
   496	- **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data
   497	- **Gate B target:** ≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked
   498	- **Build complexity:** **M** (1 week)
   499	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn ToS — we cannot store profile data beyond the audit. Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.
   500	
   501	#### A2. The Janitor — the wedge agent
   502	
   503	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 5–6)
   504	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — scheduled nightly cron
   505	- **Trigger type:** Cron 02:00 UTC daily; manual full-cleanup on demand
   506	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None (scheduled batch)
   507	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read-write), Companies House (for entity enrichment)
   508	- **Shared modules required:** Decision log writer, escalation router
   509	- **External APIs:** Bullhorn REST API, Companies House
   510	- **Gate A:** dedup confidence score ≥ 0.85 on every merge proposal; no merge proposed where candidate has had activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag
   511	- **Gate B target:** day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement
   512	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the Bullhorn MCP work is the rate-limiting piece
   513	- **Gotchas:** Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0. Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself. Dedup is hard; start conservative (high-confidence merges only) and tune up.
   514	
   515	#### A3. The Scribe — the data spine
   516	
   517	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 6–7)
   518	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — webhook-driven
   519	- **Trigger type:** Webhook from Fathom / Fireflies / Ringover when a call ends
   520	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None per call (stateless between calls)
   521	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (write), Fathom (read), Fireflies (read)
   522	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (for tone-detection of tacit notes), decision log writer
   523	- **External APIs:** Fathom webhook, Fireflies webhook, Bullhorn for write-back
   524	- **Gate A:** every transcript produces at least 3 structured-field extractions AND 1 tacit-note; tacit-notes have a confidence score ≥ 0.6
   525	- **Gate B target:** 90% of calls processed within 5 minutes of webhook; consultant edit-rate on structured fields ≤ 20%
   526	- **Build complexity:** **M** (1 week) — the structured field mapping is per-firm config, not code
   527	- **Gotchas:** Tacit-note extraction is the hard part. Start with a small taxonomy (5–10 tacit-note types) and expand. Customers will provide examples of "things I'd write down but there's no field for" — that's the training data.
   528	
   529	#### A4. Cash Conductor (real-time mode) — the FD's evenings back
   530	
   531	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 7–8)
   532	- **Always-on?** Tier 1 — persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks
   533	- **Trigger type:** Webhook (payment received, invoice issued, invoice viewed) + cron sweep at 07:00 daily
   534	- **CortexOS primitives required:** Persistent PTY (#1), Telegram approval surface (#5), standing authorisations (#4)
   535	- **MCP tools required:** Xero / QuickBooks / Sage (one of, per tenant), bank-feed connector
   536	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   537	- **External APIs:** Xero API or QuickBooks API or Sage API; bank feed via Open Banking (TrueLayer / Plaid UK)
   538	- **Gate A:** chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact; never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h
   539	- **Gate B target:** tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline
   540	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — three accounting integrations × Open Banking is the work
   541	- **Gotchas:** Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial. Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic; start with exact-amount matches and expand to fuzzy.
   542	
   543	#### A5. Sourcing Scout (daytime form) — request-response sourcing
   544	
   545	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 8–9)
   546	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — request-response
   547	- **Trigger type:** Brain UI button, Telegram command, or webhook from a "new brief" event
   548	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None for the daytime form (Night Sourcer in v1.1 will use #6)
   549	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read for ATS passive matches), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), Reed.co.uk API, CV-Library API
   550	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (for the rationale narrative), decision log writer
   551	- **External APIs:** Proxycurl, Reed, CV-Library
   552	- **Gate A:** 5–15 candidates returned per brief; each has a working contact method; each has rationale ≥ 50 words; no candidate flagged "do not contact" in tenant vault
   553	- **Gate B target:** ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)
   554	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the multi-source aggregation logic is the work
   555	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl. Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas. Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it.
   556	
   557	#### A6. The Concierge — no candidate ghosted
   558	
   559	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 9–10)
   560	- **Always-on?** Tier 1 — persistent state across the candidate lifecycle
   561	- **Trigger type:** ATS state changes (candidate moved to interview, rejected, placed, etc.) + cron sweep for time-elapsed nurture events
   562	- **CortexOS primitives required:** Persistent PTY (#1), context rotation (#2), approval gates (#4), Telegram surface (#5)
   563	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read for state, write for activity log), Microsoft Graph / Gmail (send), AgentMail (optional for agent-identity sends)
   564	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   565	- **External APIs:** Microsoft Graph or Google Workspace per tenant; AgentMail for v1.1+
   566	- **Gate A:** every lifecycle event has a draft generated within 30 minutes; voice classifier score ≥ 0.75; correct addressee resolution (no candidates emailed under another's name)
   567	- **Gate B target:** <5% candidate-ghosted rate; ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts
   568	- **Build complexity:** **XL** (4 weeks) — this is the biggest v1.0 agent because of the lifecycle state machine and the breadth of comms types (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6)
   569	- **Gotchas:** Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks. Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case — get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship.
   570	
   571	### 8.2 v1.1 agents (seven, in build order)
   572	
   573	#### A7. Inbound Triage (priority 1, 4 weeks)
   574	
   575	- **Build wave:** v1.1 (Q4 2026 weeks 1–4)

     3	**Status:** Proposed — pending Codex Day-7 ratification
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-18 (Week 0, Day 5)
     5	**Author:** Claude Code, with founder review pending
     6	**Master brief §:** §6 Day 5 (line 486) + §12 Risk Register + §1 Rule 5 (honest signal before optimistic projection)
     7	**Surfaced by:** Master brief Day 5 spec; folds carry-forwards from `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 + `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + Day-4 §11 closing-commit work.
     8	**Path drift logged:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 specifies `docs/v1-kill-criterion.md` (docs/ root). This artefact lives at `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` per repo convention. Recorded as **Edit 10** in atomic-correction manifest (shared with autosend-safety-policy.md path drift).

    11	
    12	## §1 — Definitions
    13	
    14	Three distinct end-states for v1.0:
    15	
    16	### KILL
    17	
    18	**Cease v1.0 development.** The wedge is invalidated by structural evidence. Existing pilots receive 30-day wind-down notice; assets liquidated or open-sourced; refund obligations honoured per pilot agreement. Founder pivots to next initiative.
    19	
    20	**KILL is reversible only as v1.1 or v2.0**: a wholly new initiative under different premises, with its own kill criterion. v1.0 itself does not resurrect.
    21	
    22	### PAUSE
    23	
    24	**Freeze v1.0 development for N weeks while data is gathered.** Existing pilots continue in read-only mode (agents that have shipped stay operational; no new agents ship). Founder + Jack conduct strategic review and define an unfreeze criterion.
    25	
    26	**PAUSE has a defined exit:** either unfreeze (resume v1.0 from the slice that was active when paused) OR escalate to KILL/PIVOT if the strategic review concludes the trigger is structural rather than temporary.
    27	
    28	### PIVOT
    29	
    30	**Rescope v1.0.** The wedge holds but its assumed shape is wrong. Common pivots:
    31	
    32	- **Vertical pivot:** recruitment → accountancy, insurance, or another UK SME services domain
    33	- **ATS pivot:** Bullhorn-first → Vincere-first, Voyager Infinity-first, or vertical-without-ATS
    34	- **Deployment pivot:** SaaS → self-hosted, or vice-versa
    35	- **Customer pivot:** consultant-facing → operations-team-facing → owner-facing
    36	
    37	**v1.0 commitments to existing pilots are honoured under original scope.** New v1.0 contracts under rescoped terms. The master brief and Ultraplan are amended by atomic-correction commit; Codex ratifies before v1.0 resumption.
    38	
    39	---
    40	
    41	## §2 — Binary triggers
    42	
    43	Each trigger has: measurable threshold, owner (detects), action (kill/pause/pivot), source justification.
    44	
    45	### Trigger 1 — DESIGN-PARTNER-BY-WEEK-2 (PAUSE)
    46	
    47	**Threshold:** No design partner has confirmed pilot intent (signed LOI or equivalent written commitment to pilot in Q3 2026 per master brief §6 Day 7 question 1) by end of Week 2.
    48	
    49	**Calendar:** Day 0 was 2026-05-13 (Wednesday). Week 0 runs Days 0-7, ending Wednesday 2026-05-20. Week 1 starts Thursday 2026-05-21. Week 2 ends Wednesday 2026-06-03. **Trigger fires end-of-day 2026-06-03 if criterion unmet.**
    50	
    51	**Owner:** Founder; daily check during Weeks 1-2.
    52	
    53	**Source:** Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (escalating status); Day-5 Risk #3 update reflects "zero design partners in pipeline" as of this commit; master brief §6 Day 7 question 1.
    54	
    55	**Action:** PAUSE state activated immediately. Agent code halts at end of current week's slice (rather than mid-slice). Founder pivots to full-time design-partner acquisition. Claude Code work limited to design-partner-supporting artefacts (sales decks, demo agents, pricing models).
    56	
    57	**Unfreeze criterion:** **One signed pilot LOI** from a UK recruitment agency with stated pilot start date in Q3 2026. Unfreeze formal: Founder + Jack joint sign-off on the LOI; resume v1.0 from the slice that was active when paused.
    58	
    59	**Escalation path if PAUSE extends:** if unfreeze not achieved within 4 weeks of PAUSE activation, strategic review reconvenes. Outcomes: (a) continue PAUSE if pipeline is materially active; (b) escalate to KILL if no pipeline activity; (c) escalate to PIVOT if pipeline rejection signals point to a different vertical/ATS.
    60	
    61	### Trigger 2 — DIAGNOSTIC-NO-RENDER-W3 (KILL)
    62	
    63	**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
    64	
    65	**Owner:** Claude Code (technical detection); founder review (decision authority). Weekly check during Weeks 1-3.
    66	
    67	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (i); Risk #5 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; ADR-003 §"Consequences" line 141 (renderer is load-bearing Week-1 deliverable).
    68	
    69	**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
    70	
    71	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons logged to `.agents/learnings/v1.0-postmortem.md`. v1.1 may begin as new initiative with reconsidered renderer architecture (or no per-tenant render, or different bundle pattern).
    72	
    73	### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
    74	
    75	**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
    76	
    77	**Owner:** Founder + Claude Code. Weekly check during Weeks 3-5.
    78	
    79	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (ii); Risk #2 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Sub-decisions A + B (currently Proposed pending Sunday/Monday commercial conversations — which themselves have not happened due to design-partner-pipeline gap).
    80	
    81	**Action:** PIVOT state. Rescope from Bullhorn-first to alternate ATS-first:
    82	
    83	- **Option A:** Vincere-first. Mid-market UK recruitment ATS; smaller market than Bullhorn but more accessible API.
    84	- **Option B:** Voyager Infinity-first. UK-native ATS; smaller market; alternative auth model.
    85	- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
    86	
    87	Rescope plan attached to PIVOT decision; existing pilots receive 14-day notice with rescope explanation.
    88	
    89	**Recovery path:** PIVOT is structural; resumption is via rescoped v1.0 under new ATS assumption. Pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted master brief / Ultraplan; atomic-correction commit lands the rescope.
    90	
    91	### Trigger 4 — TWO-SCOPE-CUT-ACTIVATIONS (PAUSE)
    92	
    93	**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
    94	
    95	**Owner:** Founder; logged in `.agents/decisions/` when activated.
    96	
    97	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (iii); master brief §12 Risk #4 (Hire #1 mitigation calls for scope cut from 6 → 4 agents but explicitly warns against further cuts).
    98	
    99	**Action:** PAUSE state. Rationale: two scope cuts indicates either (a) the v1.0 wedge is structurally too narrow to be valuable, or (b) build velocity is fundamentally below the rate v1.0 requires. Either way, continuing to ship more agents is the wrong move; strategic review needed.
   100	
   101	**Unfreeze criterion:** Strategic review by Founder + Jack within 2 weeks of PAUSE activation produces one of three outcomes:
   102	
   103	1. **Unfreeze with scope:** restored to 4 agents (no further cuts); resume with adjusted timeline.
   104	2. **Escalate to PIVOT:** rescope vertical or customer-type; pivoted v1.0 has new agent fleet definition.
   105	3. **Escalate to KILL:** the wedge as designed cannot ship even at reduced scope.
   106	
   107	### Trigger 5 — AUTOSEND-RED-MISCATEGORISATIONS (PAUSE)
   108	
   109	**Threshold:** More than 3 confirmed red-tier autosend breaches per pilot per week from actions that should have been classified as green or yellow. "Confirmed" means: tenant operator files a `false-block` feedback report via Brain UI (or equivalent v1.0 manual channel) AND IFOS oncall agrees the tier classification was wrong. Threshold measured per individual pilot over rolling 7-day windows.
   110	
   111	**Owner:** IFOS oncall + tenant operator. Daily check via `decision_log` queries: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_log WHERE phase='gating_failed' AND payload->>'tier'='red' AND payload->>'block_reason'='red_tier_classification' AND tenant_slug=? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
   112	
   113	**Source:** `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 + §10; Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (LUKS manual unlock has higher impact but autosend miscategorisation has higher frequency).
   114	
   115	**Action:** PAUSE for the affected pilot. The agent that produced the miscategorisations halts at next session boundary. Founder + Jack review the policy tier classifications within 48 hours. Policy revision (via Codex ratification) lands as a new commit; affected pilot receives incident report. Pilot resumes after policy revision.
   116	
   117	**Escalation path:** If three pilots experience this trigger within one quarter, escalate to system-wide PAUSE while structural autosend policy redesign happens (potential v1.1 advancement of orange tier).
   118	
   119	### Trigger 6 — UNIT-ECONOMICS-COST-PER-ACTION (PIVOT)
   120	
   121	**Threshold:** Cost-per-completed-action (defined as: total IFOS infrastructure + API + Claude inference cost ÷ count of `decision_log` rows with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier IN ('green','yellow','orange-approved')`) exceeds **£0.50 per action** after 4 tenant-weeks of operation.
   122	
   123	**Operational-guess threshold; pilot data overrides.** Tune after first 100 pilot actions provide real cost-per-action data. Pre-pilot rationale: £0.50/action × ~200 actions/tenant-month = £100/tenant-month gross cost; viable only above £500/tenant-month revenue. If first-pilot data shows on-target spend, tighten threshold to ~£0.10/action (current £0.005 estimate × 20x safety margin).
   124	
   125	The £0.50 figure assumes:
   126	
   127	- Claude Sonnet 4.6 inference at ~£0.003 per action (small prompt, output cached)
   128	- Bullhorn API call at <£0.001 per action (free tier)
   129	- Hetzner infrastructure at ~£8/mo / ~10k actions/mo ≈ £0.0008 per action
   130	- Total: ~£0.005 per action would be on-track; £0.50 is 100x over-target
   131	
   132	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check.
   133	
   134	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 pilot scale; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); emerging from v1.0 pilot operations.
   135	
   136	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.
   137	
   138	**Recovery path:** Rescoped pricing/architecture; pivoted v1.0 continues.
   139	
   140	### Trigger 7 — INFRASTRUCTURE-COST-MONTHLY (PIVOT)
   141	
   142	**Threshold:** Total Hetzner monthly infrastructure cost exceeds **£100/month at 3 active tenants**.
   143	
   144	**Rationale:** 15x headroom from the current £6.40/month single-tenant baseline (per Day-4 runbook §1.4: CX22 + 50 GB volume + backups = €5 + €1.20 + €2.40 ≈ £6.40). At 3 tenants on shared single-server architecture, expected cost should remain near baseline. If Postgres + LUKS-volume growth + vector-index growth pushes >£100/month at 3 tenants, infrastructure approach needs pivot.
   145	
   146	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check via Hetzner billing.
   147	
   148	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 single-tenant pilot; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); Risk #4 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (Hire #1 delays compound infrastructure spend if architecture sprawls).
   149	
   150	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vectors:
   151	
   152	- **Self-host:** founder's Mac Studio cluster from prior research as primary; Hetzner as backup. Saves money but adds maintenance.
   153	- **Provider switch:** alternate eu-central provider (Mythic Beasts, OVH, Scaleway) with better price-per-tenant economics.
   154	- **Architecture compaction:** per-tenant resource pooling rather than per-tenant servers.
   155	
   156	**Recovery path:** Rescoped infrastructure plan; pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (master brief does not specify a numeric cost target; budget adjustment is a runbook revision, not a master-brief edit).
   157	
   158	### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
   159	
   160	**Threshold:** After 3 completed pilots (defined as: pilot ran for ≥90 days with active agent fleet and quarterly Gate B revenue measurement), average Gate B revenue uplift per tenant <£20k/year.
   161	
   162	**Owner:** Founder; assessed at end of each pilot.
   163	
   164	**Source:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 — canonical example trigger from master brief.
   165	
   166	**Action:** KILL. Rationale: the wedge does not produce demonstrable ROI at the threshold required to sustain v1.0 commercially. £20k/year/tenant is the breakeven floor — below this, IFOS cannot fund continued operation at v1.0 pricing.
   167	
   168	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons feed v1.1 if launched. The vertical assumption (UK recruitment) or product assumption (agent fleet vs. point tools) may need reconsidering for any next initiative.
   169	
   170	### Trigger 9 — CORTEXOS-PRIMITIVE-CHRONIC-FAILURE (PAUSE)
   171	
   172	**Threshold:** cortextOS primitives 3 (file bus per `cortexos-primitive-status.md` line item 3) or 4 (approval gates per primitive 4) report >1 production incident per week across **2 consecutive weeks** for any single pilot.
   173	
   174	**Threshold tightened Day 5 (2026-05-18) from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.** Rationale: Risk #1 severity was downgraded Day 1 because primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" per `cortexos-primitive-status.md`. If field evidence shows failure-rate spike for 2 consecutive weeks, that is an actionable signal — waiting 4 weeks delays remediation by 50% within the v1.0 build timeline (Weeks 1-13).
   175	
   176	**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
   177	
   178	**Source:** Master brief §12 Risk #1; Day-1 audit results in `cortexos-primitive-status.md` (primitive 1 PTY/PM2 is "shipped but flaky"; primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" but field evidence may diverge).
   179	
   180	**Action:** PAUSE. Rationale: cortextOS primitive instability is a structural threat to every IFOS agent — every agent uses the file bus and most use approval gates. Chronic failure points to either (a) cortextOS regression upstream OR (b) IFOS usage pattern incompatible with cortextOS at scale.
   181	
   182	**Unfreeze criterion:** Either (1) cortextOS upstream PR lands the fix (per master brief §3.1 cross-vertical primitive process), OR (2) IFOS vendor-patches via `packages/harness-patches/` per master brief §3.1 fallback path. Unfreeze after **2 consecutive incident-free weeks** (matched to tightened threshold).
   183	
   184	**Escalation path:** Persistent failure after both PR and patch attempts triggers structural review — potential PIVOT to alternative runtime (different harness).
   185	
   186	### Trigger 10 — PII-LEAKAGE-INCIDENT (KILL)
   187	
   188	**Threshold:** ANY confirmed incident in which agent action results in PII (personally-identifiable information per UK GDPR Art. 4(1)) transmitted to an unauthorised party (cross-tenant recipient, unauthorised external recipient, or recipient outside tenant's declared data residency) AND not blocked by the RLS + autosend policy combination.
   189	
   190	**"Confirmed" means:** the incident is documented in `.agents/incidents/<date>-pii-leakage-<n>.md` with: recipient identity, data classes transmitted, attack vector (or accidental cause), and reproduction steps. False alarms (e.g., recipient was authorised but operator was unaware) do not trigger.

   561	
   562	**The bundle at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` is the source artefact; the cortextOS daemon does not read it directly.** The renderer (`packages/agent-renderer/`, per `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` and `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) translates the bundle into a cortextOS-shaped per-agent directory at `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` per-tenant. Source bundle authored once; rendered N times (once per active tenant). The `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command is **NOT** the IFOS path — it inherits 24 cortextOS template skills the IFOS bundle does not want.
   563	
   564	### 8.1 The three v2 changes (Ultraplan §4.2)
   565	
   566	**Change 1 — Voice handling moves into `_shared/voice-loader.sh`.** No agent reads the voice corpus directly. Every `context.sh` calls `hh_load_tone_rules`, `hh_load_voice_samples`, `hh_load_recent_edits`. Agent context scripts become 30 lines, not 200.
   567	
   568	**Change 2 — Decision logging is enforced.** Three required calls per agent run:
   569	
   570	```bash
   571	hh_decision_trigger   # at start; logs trigger
   572	hh_decision_output    # on output; logs the artefact
   573	hh_decision_action    # when human acts; logs the action
   574	```
   575	
   576	`validate.sh` hard-fails on missing calls. This is what enables the v2.0 LoRA pipeline — no decision log, no SFT corpus, no Scale-tier moat.
   577	
   578	**Change 3 — Escalation codes expand to recruitment vocabulary.** ~20–30 codes. Examples:
   579	
   580	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` — voice classifier score below threshold after retries
   581	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — OAuth token expired/revoked
   582	- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — high-confidence dedup needs human review
   583	- `ESC_JSL_RED_FLAG` — Supply Chain Auditor detected red flag
   584	- `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   585	- `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` — output references PII outside firm boundary
   586	- `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` — upstream API rate-limited (esp. LinkedIn)
   587	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — agent produced output violating vertical schema
   588	
   589	Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.
   590	
   591	### 8.2 The build order — v1.0 only
   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).
   605	
   606	### 8.3 The working pattern in Claude Code
   607	
   608	For any new agent:

    13	## Section 1 — Context and sequencing criteria
    14	
    15	### 1.1 — What we're deciding
    16	
    17	Master brief §8.2 (lines 597-611) names six v1.0 agents and assigns build weeks:
    18	
    19	| # | Agent | Weeks (master brief §8.2) | Key dependency | Why this order (master brief verbatim) |
    20	|---|---|---|---|---|
    21	| A1 | Diagnostic | 3-4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | "Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters" |
    22	| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
    23	| A3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable" |
    24	| A4 | Cash Conductor | 7-8 | Xero + Open Banking | "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'" |
    25	| A5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | "First daytime always-on agent" |
    26	| A6 | Concierge | 10-13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build" |
    27	
    28	Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
    29	
    30	**Three sub-decisions in this document:**
    31	
    32	- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
    33	- **B. Sequence for agents 2-6.** The remaining five agents in some order across Weeks 5-13. Three candidate orderings compared in §3.
    34	- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
    35	
    36	### 1.2 — Why this matters now
    37	
    38	Three reasons the sequencing decision lands this week, not later:
    39	
    40	**Week 3 needs a starting agent.** The renderer (ADR-003) lands Week 1-2; `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` land Week 1-2; Postgres `decision_log` lands Day 4 Week 0. By Week 3 the substrate is live and waiting for its first user. Without §A (first agent), Week 3 doesn't have a build target.
    41	
    42	**Weeks 5-13 planning is speculative without §B.** Each agent's prerequisites (Bullhorn MCP, Fathom/Fireflies, Xero, LinkedIn) have lead times. Bullhorn MCP work itself starts Week 1 per Ultraplan §9 line 724 ("Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it"). Without knowing the agent build order, those infrastructure prereqs can't be sequenced.
    43	
    44	**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
    45	
    46	The Day-7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 Day 7 / Ultraplan §12) doesn't directly test sequencing — but Q4 ("Have we scoped the Agent Bundle v2 refactor and is the work <5 days?") and the Week-0 deliverable list at Ultraplan §9 line 737-741 both assume a sequenced plan exists. The Day 7 review surfaces this document for Codex ratification.
    47	
    48	### 1.3 — Sequencing criteria
    49	
    50	Six criteria to evaluate each agent against in §2. Each criterion scored High / Medium / Low or with a concrete number; substantive cells in §2 must justify the score by reference to master brief / Ultraplan / Product Spec / Day-2 Bullhorn decision.
    51	
    52	| # | Criterion | What it measures | Why it informs sequencing |
    53	|---|---|---|---|
    54	| 1 | **Implementation simplicity** | Lines of agent code in `agent.md` workflow + number of MCP servers touched + complexity of output contract (single-output vs multi-stage vs lifecycle-state) | Simpler agents land faster and exercise less substrate at once — better first-agent candidates because failure modes are easier to isolate |
    55	| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
    56	| 3 | **Risk de-risking** | Which named risks the agent's success/failure surfaces — Risk #1 (cortextOS primitives), Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth), Risk #5 (renderer-not-built) — per `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` | Building risk-surfacing agents earlier converts known-unknowns into known-knowns; building risk-deferring agents earlier preserves optionality but pushes the surprise window later |
    57	| 4 | **Commercial value** | Whether the agent's output is demoable to a design partner / first paying customer per Product Spec §2.2 R-rows | Earlier commercial-value agents accelerate the first-pilot conversion (Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12); but commercial-value agents are typically the more complex ones, conflicting with criterion 1 |
    58	| 5 | **Dependencies on other agents** | Does this agent's output feed another agent? Does this agent require another agent's output to function? | Agents with downstream dependents should ship before their dependents; agents with no upstream dependencies are good first candidates |
    59	| 6 | **Tenant-onboarding readiness** | Can this agent be deployed to one tenant without all infrastructure being live? (E.g. does it need the wiki API in v1.0 weeks 11-13, or only the Week-1-2 substrate?) | Earlier-readiness agents can pilot in shadow mode against the first design partner before all v1.0 infra is complete |
    60	
    61	The six criteria intentionally tension against each other — implementation simplicity (1) trades off against commercial value (4); substrate exercise (2) trades off against risk-isolation (3). The §2 per-agent assessments make the trade-offs visible per agent; the §3 sequencing options weight them differently; the §4 recommendation picks one weighting.
    62	
    63	### 1.4 — Scope cuts and v1.0 minimum
    64	
    65	Per master brief §12 / Ultraplan §10 row #2 (the four-risks-that-kill-v1.0 table), the **documented v1.0 scope-cut contingency** is verbatim:
    66	
    67	> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
    68	
    69	There are actually **two named contingency paths**, corresponding to two different failing risks:
    70	
    71	- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
    72	- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
    73	
    74	Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
    75	
    76	The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
    77	
    78	### 1.5 — One small but real finding before §2 begins
    79	
    80	Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
    81	
    82	Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
    83	
    84	**Section 4's recommendation evaluates both orderings** (founder-prompt-Alpha and master-brief-Alpha) against the §1.3 criteria, picks whichever wins on the merits, and explicitly aligns with the master brief by default unless rationale exists to revise it. This document is the "confirm or revise" decision per master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 — both options are on the table.
    85	
    86	---
    87	
    88	## Section 2 — Per-agent readiness assessment
    89	
    90	Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.
    91	
    92	### 2.1 — A1 Diagnostic
    93	
    94	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
    95	|---|---|---|
    96	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
    97	| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
    98	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
    99	| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Internal sales tool per Product Spec §2.2 R13 ("Not on the customer pricing card"). Drives qualified discovery-call pipeline. Demoable to a prospect but not the closing demo. Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target: "≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked" |
   100	| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **None** | Standalone. No upstream agent dependency; no downstream agent consumes Diagnostic output |
   101	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **High** | Runnable from end of Week 2 with renderer + `_shared/` + Postgres decision_log. No vault `_secrets.env` complexity (no per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth needed), no wiki API needed. Single-tenant deployable immediately |
   102	
   103	**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
   104	
   105	### 2.2 — A2 Janitor
   106	
   107	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
   108	|---|---|---|
   109	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 513 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — the Bullhorn MCP work is rate-limiting per Ultraplan §8.1 line 514 ("Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build"). One MCP server (Bullhorn) + Companies House for enrichment. Single primary output (cleanup report) but with continuous nightly cron pattern |
   110	| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
   111	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
   112	| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
   113	| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
   114	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
   115	
   116	**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.

   118	### 2.3 — A3 Scribe
   119	
   120	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
   121	|---|---|---|
   122	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 526 estimate **M (1 week)**. Webhook-driven not always-on. Structured-field mapping is per-firm config not code per Ultraplan §8.1 line 526. Tacit-note extraction is the hard part per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 ("Start with a small taxonomy (5-10 tacit-note types) and expand") |
   123	| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
   124	| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
   125	| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 603: "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable." Product Spec §2.2 R6: "Your firm's institutional memory finally lives somewhere." Critical downstream: **every Tier-1 v1.0 agent reuses Scribe's voice-and-tacit-note plumbing** |
   126	| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
   127	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |
   128	
   129	**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.

    38	#   HNSW indexes which need real columns + indexes, not JSONB blobs, and (b) RLS

    43	#   v0.1) — read it as "new domain entities introduced in v0.2", not as "rows in the

    57	    description: |
    58	      Per-tenant pack of source documents that define the firm's outbound voice — emails the consultant has written, prior Bullhorn Notes, marketing copy, founder-curated style examples. Read by hh_load_voice_samples (semantic ANN retrieval against the embedded chunks). One voice_corpus per tenant; versioned so re-indexing produces a new row rather than mutating the live pack.
    59	    bullhorn_source: none (IFOS-derived from /vault/<tenant>/_voice/ ingest)
    60	    v1_0_agent_access:
    61	      - Scribe (R — voice samples for note-summary tone matching)

    68	        source: IFOS-derived (set at row insert from CTX_TENANT_SLUG)
    69	        notes: RLS-isolated per tenant. Maps to entities.tenant_slug at row level.
    70	      version:

    72	        required: true
    73	        source: IFOS-derived (operator names at re-index time)
    74	        notes: |
    75	          Semver tag (e.g. "v0.1", "v0.2-2026-06-15"). Bump on re-index. Live pack is the row with `is_active: true`; historical packs preserved for audit + rollback per master brief §3.3 audit discipline.
    76	      source_doc_count:
    77	        type: integer
    78	        required: true
    79	        source: IFOS-derived (counted by ingest pipeline)
    80	        notes: Number of source documents ingested into this version (emails + notes + marketing). Sanity check during re-index.
    81	      source_doc_origin:
    82	        type: array
    83	        required: true
    84	        source: IFOS-derived (vault _voice/ subdirectory enumeration)
    85	        notes: |
    86	          Items enum: ["vault_emails", "bullhorn_notes", "marketing_copy", "founder_curated", "consultant_drafts"]. Order documents provenance for the LoRA pipeline (v2.0 Scale tier).
    87	      chunk_count:
    88	        type: integer
    89	        required: true
    90	        source: IFOS-derived (computed by chunking pass)
    91	        notes: Number of text chunks produced from the source corpus after the chunking pass. One chunk = one row in the pgvector index.

    96	        notes: |
    97	          Enum: ["paragraph", "sentence-window-5", "semantic-segment-v1"]. v0.2 ships with "paragraph" (simplest, deterministic). Other values reserved for v1.1 experimentation per Q5 voice gate research.
    98	      embedding_model:
    99	        type: string
   100	        required: true
   101	        source: IFOS-derived (config; default text-embedding-3-small)
   102	        notes: |
   103	          Identifier of the embedding model used to populate the pgvector column. v0.2 ships with "text-embedding-3-small" (1536 dimensions); revising model triggers re-index + new version row.
   104	      last_indexed_at:
   105	        type: timestamp
   106	        required: true
   107	        source: IFOS-derived (timestamped at ingest completion)
   108	        notes: When the indexing pipeline last completed for this version. Set on row insert; never updated post-insert (immutability of versioned packs).
   109	      is_active:
   110	        type: boolean
   111	        required: true
   112	        source: IFOS-derived (atomic flip on version rollover)
   113	        notes: True for the version currently served to hh_load_voice_samples. Exactly one row per tenant has `is_active=true` (enforced via partial unique index).
   114	      ingest_completion_ms:
   115	        type: integer
   116	        required: false
   117	        source: IFOS-derived (observability counter; pipeline timing)
   118	        notes: How long the ingest+chunk+embed pipeline took. Observability only.
   119	    notes: |
   120	      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
   185	    notes: |
   186	      Tone rules are the explicit complement to voice_corpus's implicit grounding. v0.2 ships with ~5-15 rules per tenant (curated at onboarding). v1.1 grows the rule library based on recent_edit patterns (tenant-specific drift becomes a rule).

   190	    description: |
   191	      Human edit to an agent's output captured at the point the consultant approves/edits/rejects a draft. Drives (a) the voice-drift-canary nightly cron, (b) future LoRA SFT pair generation per Ultraplan §6.1, (c) classifier retraining queue. Append-only per master brief §3.3 audit discipline.

   206	        notes: |
   207	          The agent whose draft was edited. Matches decision_log.agent_name. NOT entity_type — this is a metadata link to the producing agent, not to a domain entity.

   210	        required: true
   211	        source: IFOS-derived (lookup against autosend-policy.yaml at edit time)
   212	        notes: References autosend-policy.yaml action_types. Drives per-action-type drift detection (e.g., are bullhorn_note_draft_internal drafts edited more than email_summary_to_customer drafts).
   213	      target_entity_type:
   214	        type: string
   215	        required: false
   216	        source: IFOS-derived (entity context at edit time; nullable for system-level edits)
   217	        notes: |
   218	          Optional pointer to the entity the draft was about (e.g. "candidate", "client"). Enables linking voice drift to entity classes (some entity types correlate with more drift).
   219	      target_entity_id:
   220	        type: string
   221	        required: false
   222	        source: IFOS-derived (entity ID at edit time; Bullhorn ID or IFOS slug)

   227	        source: IFOS-derived (agent's draft as produced; capped at 8192 chars)
   228	        notes: |
   229	          The agent's draft as produced. **Stored verbatim** (privacy posture: this is the agent's own output, not external PII). Length-capped at 8192 chars; if longer, suffix truncated with "[...]" marker.

   384	  Q11_voice_corpus_chunk_storage:
   385	    question: |
   386	      Should voice_corpus_chunks store the raw text alongside the embedding, or only the embedding + a pointer back to the source document in /vault/?
   387	    options:
   388	      - A: Store both — duplicates ~50MB/tenant but enables fast retrieval without vault round-trip
   389	      - B: Store embedding + pointer — saves disk, requires vault read per top-K retrieval (latency cost)
   390	    v0_2_default: A (store both); revise to B if disk pressure surfaces at >50 tenants
   391	    trigger_for_revisit: tenant count > 50 OR pgvector storage > 10% of total disk
   392	
   393	  Q12_tone_rule_severity_block_path:
   394	    question: |
   395	      When a `severity: block` tone_rule fires Gate A, does the agent retry once, three times, or surface ESC_VOICE_DRIFT immediately?
   396	    options:
   397	      - A: Single retry then escalate (current Ultraplan §5.3 default)
   398	      - B: Three retries then escalate
   399	      - C: No retry; immediate escalate (operator triages drift in real-time)
   400	    v0_2_default: A; matches Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget for green-path agents
   401	    trigger_for_revisit: first Concierge build (W10) — measure real retry success rate
   402	
   403	  Q13_recent_edit_retention_under_GDPR:
   404	    question: |
   405	      Indefinite retention of original_text + edited_text plausibly exceeds GDPR "data minimisation" tests. Is retention of (edit_distance + resolution + tone_rules_triggered) sufficient for v2.0 LoRA SFT pair generation, with the text bodies purged after 90 days?
   406	    options:
   407	      - A: Indefinite retention (current v0.2 default; maximises LoRA training signal)
   408	      - B: Text bodies purged after 90 days; metadata retained indefinitely
   409	      - C: Text bodies purged after pilot ends (tenant-controlled retention)

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:69:        notes: RLS-isolated per tenant. Maps to entities.tenant_slug at row level.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:120:      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:132:      tenant_slug:
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:140:        notes: Stable slug, e.g. "no-i-hope-this-finds-you-well". Referenced by recent_edit when a rule fires.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:151:          Enum: ["info", "warn", "block"]. `info` is observational (logged, not enforced); `warn` shows up in decision_log without blocking; `block` is a Gate-A hard-fail (causes regenerate-with-feedback per Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:157:          Items: agent_name slugs from master brief §8.2 (e.g. ["scribe", "concierge"]). Empty array = applies to all agents. tone_rule rows MUST set this to at least one agent; "all agents" requires the empty-array literal.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:186:      Tone rules are the explicit complement to voice_corpus's implicit grounding. v0.2 ships with ~5-15 rules per tenant (curated at onboarding). v1.1 grows the rule library based on recent_edit patterns (tenant-specific drift becomes a rule).

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:212:        notes: References autosend-policy.yaml action_types. Drives per-action-type drift detection (e.g., are bullhorn_note_draft_internal drafts edited more than email_summary_to_customer drafts).

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:247:          Enum: ["approved_verbatim", "approved_after_edit", "rejected", "deferred"]. `deferred` indicates operator returned to inbox without resolving (4h timeout case).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:259:      recent_edit is the most privacy-sensitive entity in v0.2 because it stores raw agent output (potentially including names, salaries, etc. — anything the agent drafted). RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:279:      Per-tenant query pattern via RLS: SELECT * FROM voice_corpus_chunks WHERE tenant_slug = current_setting('app.current_tenant') ORDER BY embedding <=> $query_vec LIMIT 10.

M:N because one recent_edit may inform multiple future corpus versions (longitudinal SFT data); one corpus version draws from many edits.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:373:  decision_log_phase_implication: |
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:374:    No new phase values needed. recent_edit writes piggy-back on existing `phase='action'` + `phase='gating_failed'` distinctions for the underlying autosend decision. tone_rule mutations write as decision_log with `agent_name='_tenant_admin'` + `phase='trigger'` per autosend §8 override propagation pattern.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:155:      A person engaged on contract or temporary terms (vs. permanent placement). Distinct entity_type per Day-6 founder Q1 decision — separated from `candidate` for query clarity, IR35 first-class, and autosend policy distinguishing contractor vs candidate action_types.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:321:        notes: v0.1 is essentially a tag for Concierge addressee-resolution gating; v1.1 Triage agent owns expansion (sub-fields for decision-domain, budget authority, etc.).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:334:        source: IFOS-derived (Concierge addressee-resolution gate per bullhorn §4.1 A6)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:337:      - v1.0 is intentionally thin — only the fields Concierge addressee-resolution needs for orange-tier sends.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:348:      - Scribe (R — write-context resolution per bullhorn §4.1 A3)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:599:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge reads to anchor lifecycle communications; Scribe reads for write-context resolution.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:615:    v1_0_exercise: Concierge reads for addressee-resolution per bullhorn §4.1 A6 Voice gate; addressee = primary decision-maker contact.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:697:    brief: R         # write-context resolution
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:726:    contact: R       # decision-maker resolution for orange-tier sends
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:800:    rationale: Autosend policy distinguishes contractor vs candidate action_types; kill criterion + pilot liability treat contractor data differently (IR35, contractor-specific residency); type-first-class beats status-flag-filtered for queryability. Adapter overhead is minimal single conditional.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:804:    v0_1_decision: Bullhorn Notes ingest into `decision_log.payload` with `payload.note_content`, `payload.bullhorn_note_id`, `payload.note_external_visibility` (boolean). Not a top-level entity_type in v0.1.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:806:    rationale: Notes operationally ARE the audit trail (autosend-policy.md §7 confirms); decision_log has RLS + tier metadata + payload_hash for audit; avoid dual-storage problem at v1.0; cheap to promote later if needed.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:816:    decision: System agent names like `_renderer` are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only, with `phase` from the live 5-value enum (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff` per Day-4 §6.3 + Day-5 migration). The sentinel `_renderer` writes `phase='gating_failed'` for failures and `phase='action'` for successful renders per ADR-004 Decision 7.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:817:    rationale: Vertical schema covers tenant-domain entities only. System-internal agents (renderer, validators, ingest pipeline) live in decision_log audit but are not first-class business entities.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:856:    rationale: v1.0 Concierge addressee-resolution uses primary-decision-maker; panel modelling adds value when v1.1 Triage handles inbound brief queries from multiple stakeholders.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:872:      Codex Day-7 ratification reviews whether stricter source-field schema would improve machine-parseability. If accepted, v1.0 introduces structured source object — e.g., `source: {origin: bullhorn | ifos_derived, bullhorn_field?: <entity.field>, ifos_agent?: <agent_name>, citation?: <doc-ref>}`.

Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='_consultant_feedback'` + `phase='action'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field).

agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Drafts are orange-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` — consultant approval required before send via the autosend-bridge mechanism (Founder Decision D1 path A bridge OR D1-B shim OR D1-C manual; W10 design selects). Sends route via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; AgentMail deferred to v1.1+). Gate A hard-fails any draft generated >30 minutes after lifecycle event, any draft with voice classifier <0.75, or any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). Gate B success threshold: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:43:**Disposition:** **Codex is correct.** Real bug. Step 11 sends a Telegram notification (an action with external side-effect) but doesn't emit a `decision_log` row. Mechanical fix: add `hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", ...)` call to Step 11.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:63:**Codex says:** "Line 167 writes feedback rows as `agent_name='_consultant_feedback'`, but the existing documented sentinels are `_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, and `_codex_ratifier`; `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` lines 16 and 257 only describe the firing agent or `_renderer` for shared helpers."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:71:Option B — **Use `agent_name='diagnostic'` with payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`.** Avoids creating a new sentinel; feedback is "still Diagnostic's work, just consultant-driven not agent-driven."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:73:**My recommendation:** **B** — cleaner, avoids sentinel proliferation. Feedback events are conceptually Diagnostic's domain (they validate Diagnostic outputs), so the agent_name should be Diagnostic with a specific action_type marker.

Disposition: prefer `agent_name='<agent>'` with `payload.action_type` markers; reserve sentinels for system actors (_renderer, _tenant_admin, _codex_ratifier).
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:146:- Sentinel hygiene (Issue 4) is a real architectural concern; agent_name=agent + payload.action_type is the cleaner pattern; no reason to proliferate sentinels.

docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:14:- `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §3 (defines 4 tiers + classifies 10 action_types as orange)
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:20:**Real issue:** 10 action_types (including the canonical orange `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` — Concierge's primary outbound action) are classified as orange. v1.0 ships green+red only. In v1.0, those orange action_types must either:
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:22:- **D1-A: Become red in v1.0** — refuse all orange action_types entirely. Concierge can't send customer-visible Bullhorn Notes at all in v1.0. Diagnostic can't send outbound emails. Cash Conductor can't send payment reminders. **Reduces Concierge to draft-only voice-classified output that the consultant manually copies.** Concierge's pitch becomes "drafts that pass voice gate" instead of "auto-send with approval gate".
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:24:- **D1-C: Ship orange-as-red default + manual override** — orange action_types refused by default in v1.0, but per-action manual approval via founder's Telegram bot allowed as escape hatch. Pragmatic; aligns with autosend §9 "orange handled outside the policy pipeline" wording. **Closest to current artefact wording but explicit about the manual surface.**
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:30:**Recommended timing:** Week 9 (default; sequential with master brief §8.2). Pre-builds the bridge before Concierge W10-13 starts. Allows: Day 1-2 = bridge code + tests; Day 3 = live integration test on migration-test tenant; Day 4 (Concierge W10 start) = Concierge uses bridge from day 1. No timeline pressure on Diagnostic W3-4 or Janitor W5 (neither use orange tier action_types).
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:49:**Real issue:** v1.0 kill-criterion §3.4 names "external advisor" as a Week 1-2 must-fill. This is also the resolution path for autosend §10 pilot-agreement liability. Today = 2026-05-20 (Day 8 = Week 1 underway). No advisor identified.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:62:## D3 — v0.2 recent_edit PII retention
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:68:**Codex's framing:** "`recent_edit` stores raw PII-bearing text while claiming it is not external PII. Lines 179-188 store `original_text` and `edited_text` verbatim, and line 208 admits these can include names and salaries. This violates the autosend `payload_preview` PII discipline unless retention/redaction is enforced. Fix by adding redaction rules or making Q13's 90-day purge/legal review a pre-ratification blocker."
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:70:**Real issue:** `recent_edit.original_text` + `edited_text` are CAPPED at 8192 chars but otherwise stored verbatim. The agent's draft AND the consultant's edited version. Both can contain PII (candidate names, salaries, contact info). Indefinite retention for LoRA SFT training. UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) "data minimisation" arguably requires bounded retention.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:74:- **D3-B: 90-day text purge + indefinite metadata** — purge `original_text` + `edited_text` after 90 days; keep `edit_distance` + `resolution` + `tone_rules_triggered` (already aggregates) forever. **Loses some SFT corpus signal** but retains the "what rules fired" signal indefinitely.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:80:**Cost of delay:** Same as D2 — Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03. If LOI lands before D3 resolves, founder ships v1.0 with D3-A indefinite retention, which is the worst legal posture. Bundle D2 + D3 resolution.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:127:Round 2 expectations after this resolution:

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:932:- Don't skip Codex ratification at phase boundaries
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:21:| 5 | **Renderer-not-built** — without ADR-003 + the IFOS bundle renderer code, no IFOS agent can run because the daemon reads from `orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` but the v2 bundle lives at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` | High (severity unchanged; staged-ladder mid-stage) | High | Week-4 Diagnostic render fails or doesn't run | **Updated Day 8 (2026-05-20):** **Renderer code shipped.** `packages/agent-renderer/` complete at `3c16d35` — 8 TypeScript source files, 30 Vitest unit tests all green, end-to-end render verified against test fixture (`outcome=rendered`, 10 files, ~23ms), `cortextos-ifos list-agents` discoverAgents() smoke confirms daemon-discovery works, Risk #1 stress test 10-iter stable, goals.json drift-check NO DRIFT at pinned SHA c21fbfe. `_shared/` runtime: hook-helpers.sh + autosend-policy.yaml + voice-loader.sh all shellcheck-clean + 29 Bash tests passing (`e6e9df1` + `fe56e93`). Vertical-schema v0.2 voice corpus substrate + migration SQL (`45b59e0`). **Risk #5 stays at High** per the staged ladder: ADR-003 line 145 requires BOTH "renderer code committed" (now ✓) AND "Diagnostic agent renders cleanly (Week 4)" for High → Medium. Diagnostic bundle does not yet exist (gated on Q1 design partner LOI per Risk #3). When Diagnostic first renders cleanly at W4, severity drops to Medium. Three implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: (a) CLI-name divergence (`ifos-render-agent` standalone vs `cortextos-ifos render-agent` per ADR-003 §3.3.1; submodule read-only boundary prevents the latter); (b) `_shared/` symlink target counting error in ADR-003 §3.3.3 (spec says `../../_shared`, correct is `../../../_shared` — 3 vs 4 levels); (c) phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `cortextos-ifos list-agents` (renderer correctness unaffected; cosmetic). **Owner:** Claude Code Day 8 commit chain shipped; founder for Diagnostic-build green-light when Q1 turns YES. |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:25:| 10 | **`recent_edit` raw PII retention vs UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) data minimisation** — `vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml` §1 `recent_edit` entity stores `original_text` + `edited_text` verbatim (length-capped 8192 chars), each potentially containing candidate names, salaries, contact info. v0.2 default is indefinite retention to support v2.0 LoRA SFT corpus. Arguably violates GDPR data-minimisation requirement absent retention rules + redaction protocol. | **Medium** (probability GDPR enforcement action depends on pilot scale + regulator interest) | **High** (regulator notification + fines + reputational damage; potential pilot LOI block) | First pilot LOI signing window approaches AND external advisor (D2) hasn't engaged AND PII retention decision (D3) is unresolved. | **Surfaced by Codex Round 1** (`logs/codex-ratification/manual-run/docs_verticals_recruitment_vertical_schema_v0_2_supplement_yaml.output.md` issue 4). Resolution path: bundle Founder Decision D2 (external advisor engagement) + D3 (90-day text purge vs indefinite vs pilot-controlled) in `2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md`. **Pre-LOI blocker per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §3.4 external-advisor must-fill.** Recommended: D2-A + D3-D (engage advisor this week; D3 decision follows advisor's recommendation; likely D3-B = 90-day text purge + indefinite metadata). **Owner:** founder for D2 + D3; Claude Code for implementation once decisions land. **Source:** Codex Round-1 ratification of v0.2 supplement; also master brief §3 vault/Postgres split + autosend §10 pilot-agreement liability placeholder. |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:33:| 11 | **Tenant-context guard failure due transactionless `SET LOCAL` usage** — scripts and helpers used `SET LOCAL ifos.tenant_slug` in psql heredocs/strings without visible `BEGIN/COMMIT`. If PostgreSQL treats the setting as transaction-local with no active transaction, RLS-protected reads/writes can return zero rows, fail audit inserts, or silently fall back to JSONL. | ~~High~~ → Low post-remediation | High | Any psql call with `SET LOCAL` not bracketed by `BEGIN/COMMIT`, or a successful operation whose decision_log row falls back because RLS rejected the insert. | Round-2 remediation Fix 3-5 wraps every `SET LOCAL` psql call in a transaction. Verified by shellcheck + 29 helper tests + Round 3. | **Mitigated in this commit; Round-3 verified.** |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:34:| 12 | **PII purge remediation cannot execute against current schema** — `v0.2-to-v0.3-pii-purge.sql` adds `text_purged_at` and a CHECK requiring text fields to be NULL after purge, but v0.2 declares `recent_edit.original_text TEXT NOT NULL`; the purge script sets `original_text=NULL`. | ~~High~~ → Low post-remediation | ~~High~~ → Low for cron execution; legal posture still depends on D2/D3 | `v0.2-to-v0.3-pii-purge.sql` executed without `ALTER COLUMN original_text DROP NOT NULL`. | Round-2 remediation Fix 2 adds `ALTER COLUMN DROP NOT NULL` before the CHECK constraint. Verified by Round 3. | **Mitigated in this commit; remains pending D2/D3 founder decisions before production deployment.** |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:36:| 13 | **GUC name drift between executed Day-4 reality and Days-8-11 codebase** — Day-4 §6.3 provisioned live RLS policies using `current_setting('app.current_tenant', TRUE)` (verified Day-11 via `\dp entities`), but Days 8-11 code (hook-helpers.sh, voice-loader.sh, run-live-migration.sh, run-tenancy-audit.sh, ifos-pii-purge.sh, v0.1-to-v0.2.sql) + Day-9 ratified docs (tenancy-invariants.md, architecture-cohesion-review.md) wrote `ifos.tenant_slug` instead. Three rounds of Codex ratification + cohesion review didn't catch it because no artefact in Days 8-11 was ever executed end-to-end against live Postgres. Surfaced 2026-05-22 during first live migration attempt (CREATE TRIGGER failed for separate privilege reason; founder ran `\dp entities` while diagnosing; the GUC mismatch was visible in policy output). | ~~High~~ → Low post-remediation | High (every Days-8-11 write to live Postgres would have silently failed RLS or returned 0 rows — silent data leak risk if ever inverted) | Any helper / migration / script execution against live Postgres that uses an RLS-protected table and returns surprising row counts; first end-to-end live execution of any of the 6 affected scripts; future `\dp` audit revealing additional drift. | Day-11 remediation (this commit): mechanical rename `ifos.tenant_slug` → `app.current_tenant` across 15 files; 29/29 helper tests still pass; v0.1-to-v0.2 migration verified to use the corrected GUC. Future: run `bash scripts/run-tenancy-audit.sh` post-migration to verify all 12 invariants against the live database. | **Mitigated in this commit pending live re-run of v0.2 migration + tenancy audit verification.** |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:46:- Two-instance PATH conflict for bus commands → **Updated 2026-05-16 evening:** folds into the renderer's CLAUDE.md preamble responsibility (ADR-003 design §2.1-A). The preamble draft in design §2.3 sets `CTX_AGENT_DIR` explicitly; rendered hook scripts source `_shared/` helpers via `${CTX_AGENT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/_shared/` rather than relying on `PATH` resolution. Quirk 3 is no longer a Week-1 risk — it's a renderer test case.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:55:- 2026-05-22 (Day 11) — **Codex Round 2 autonomous ratification complete.** 26 artefacts reviewed; 17 RATIFIED / 9 REJECTED. Manifest §1.7 appended and full outputs written to `logs/codex-ratification/round-2-autonomous/`. D5 skill softening ratified. Bullhorn gate disagreement rejected because the promised source-doc sharpening did not land. Autosend policy, v0.2 supplement, approval bridge, PII purge runbook/script/forward migration, and tenancy audit script remain rejected. **New Risk #11** added for transactionless `SET LOCAL` usage across live DB scripts/helpers. **New Risk #12** added for the PII purge migration/script mismatch with `recent_edit.original_text NOT NULL`.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:56:- 2026-05-22 (Day 11 evening) — **Codex Round-2 remediation applied + Round 3 verified.** Fixes wrap all identified `SET LOCAL` calls in explicit transactions and make `recent_edit.original_text` nullable before PII purge; Risks #11 and #12 moved to mitigated. Founder-domain D1/D2/D3 remain open and are explicitly annotated in the affected artefacts.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:61:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:64:- 2026-05-18 (Day 5) — **Day 5 decision artefacts shipped: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` + `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` (both Status: Proposed).** Auto-send safety policy specifies 4-tier traffic light (green/yellow/orange/red), `hh_decision_action` integration per ADR-003 §2.1, 3 new `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` codes (`ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`), pilot-agreement liability placeholder (legal review required before first LOI), v1.0 ships green+red only / yellow+orange phased to v1.1. Kill criterion specifies 10 binary triggers spanning design-partner gap (Trigger 1 = Week-3 PAUSE), renderer build (Trigger 2 = W3 KILL), Bullhorn auth (Trigger 3 = W5 PIVOT), scope cuts (Trigger 4 from sequencing-target §6.6), autosend miscategorisations (Trigger 5), unit economics + infra cost (Triggers 6+7 = PIVOT), Gate B revenue (Trigger 8 = KILL per master brief example), cortextOS primitive stability (Trigger 9), PII leakage (Trigger 10 = unilateral KILL). **Risk #3 escalated from Medium to High** — zero design partners in pipeline as of Day 5; original "conversation 1" assumption invalidated. **Risk #7 edit count revised from 9 to 10** with new Edit 10 (master brief §6 Day 5 lines 484-485 path drift `docs/` root → `docs/decisions/`). Codex Day-7 queue grows from 15 to 17 (both Day-5 artefacts).
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:66:- 2026-05-20 (Day 8 evening) — **Codex ratification Round 1 complete + remediation landed.** 16 artefacts reviewed (Cluster A+B+C); 2 RATIFIED (ADR-004, brain-ui-scope); 14 REJECTED. Remediation commit `2b287d3` incorporates 13 of 14 rejections (Bucket 1 cosmetic + Bucket 2 ADR-004 back-propagation + Bucket 3 structural). 2 disagreement docs filed (`codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-decision-doc-shape-on-audits.md` + `codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md`). 5 founder decisions surfaced (D1-D5 in `2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md`). **NEW Risk #10 candidate surfaced by Codex** (recent_edit raw PII retention vs UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) data minimisation) — see Risk #10 below. Manifest queue updated with per-artefact Round-1 verdicts (`docs/decisions/2026-05-18-codex-ratification-manifest.md` §1.5). Round 2 expected to take 14 REJECTED → 0-2 REJECTED.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:67:- 2026-05-20 (Day 8) — **Week-1 product-code slice (plan `bubbly-snuggling-lantern.md`) shipped end-to-end in a single session.** 8 commits on `origin/main` (a279226 → 67a2320), ~6,500 lines across 50+ files, 59 passing tests (30 Vitest renderer + 29 Bash helpers/loader). All 5 phases landed: (1) renderer prereqs + ESC catalogue, (2) `packages/agent-renderer/` TS scaffold, (3) `hook-helpers.sh` + `autosend-policy.yaml`, (4) vertical-schema v0.2 voice corpus supplement + migration SQL, (5) `voice-loader.sh`. **Risk #5 status update: renderer code committed (✓);** Risk #5 stays at High per ADR-003 line 145 staged ladder (requires BOTH "renderer code committed" AND "Diagnostic agent renders cleanly at W4" for High → Medium). Diagnostic bundle still blocked by Risk #3 / Q1 design-partner LOI. Three ADR-003 implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: CLI-name divergence + symlink target counting error + phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `list-agents`. 4 of 11 Day-7-honest-read gaps fully closed (#1 voice schema, #2 preamble, #3 common schemas, #4 autosend policy YAML); 2 side-effect closed (#6 ESC catalogue, partial #10 phase enum); 5 explicitly deferred with named owner + trigger. **Codex Day-7 queue grows from 21 to 33 items** (12 new artefacts: 8 common-*.json + preamble + ESC catalogue + renderer scaffold + autosend YAML + hook-helpers + voice-loader + 2 test harnesses + v0.2 supplement + 2 migration SQL files). Live VPS smoke tests + Phase 5 migration execution remain pending (Path A founder action; documented in `agents/_shared/README.md §"Live integration test"` + `§"Phase 5 live migration"`). No new risks surfaced from the 5-phase slice.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:17:Intel Force OS is the always-on operating system for UK recruitment agencies. It runs on CortexOS as the persistent agent runtime, lives inside each firm's existing stack (Bullhorn / Vincere / Voyager Infinity, Xero / Sage, Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace), and ships as two coordinated product lines — **IntelForce Recruit** for the front office and **IntelForce Temp** for the back office. Together they replace the operational drag of an entire junior team and, more importantly, generate revenue: surfaced BD opportunities, intercepted competitor briefs, faster cash collection, dormant-candidate reactivation, and post-placement nurture that compounds into referrals. The firm pays £499–£6,950/month per front-office tier and a separate £1,950–£5,950/month for the temp sub-platform. Every agent is pitched against a single, quantified outcome the buyer can verify within 90 days. Configuration scales because the moat is the per-vertical schema, not per-customer plumbing — onboarding becomes a 5-day wizard, not a 5-week project.
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:58:- **Revenue story** — the one quantified outcome the buyer signs against

docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:6:**Surfaced by:** Master brief §6 Day 3 line 472 — "Brain UI v1.0 scope decision" + ADR-002 §3.4 closing paragraph (Brain UI explicitly forward-deferred to v1.1) + `second-brain-design.md` §3.4 ("Brain UI minimal v1 is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed").
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:17:- **v1.0 minimum (weeks 11-13):** wiki API + Postgres tables (`tenants`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`) + pgvector voice samples + 9 `wiki-*.sh` parallel wrappers + 9 `wiki/lib/*.ts` modules. **No Brain UI** — operational access via Obsidian + CLI + psql.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:22:This document scopes the **v1.1 Brain UI work without committing to implementation details.** The decision deferral is by design — at v1.1 phase start, founder + Claude Code will have observed v1.0 actual wiki usage patterns and can scope sub-features and implementation choices against real evidence rather than speculation.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:24:**Revisit trigger:** start of v1.1 phase (estimated Q4 2026 post-v1.0 launch per Ultraplan §9 line 725 + Product Spec §9.2 v1.1 timing). Three v1.0 observations will inform the v1.1 scoping session:
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:26:1. Which wiki operations get hit hardest in v1.0 (decision_log queries vs entity reads vs entity_links traversals) — informs which feature lands first in v1.1.

docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:44:- Per-tenant scoped via RLS per ADR-002 §3 Decision 3; multi-tenant founder view aggregates across tenant_slugs.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:53:**Likely implementation surface:** Next.js route at `/brain/today` (or equivalent), reading Postgres `decision_log` + `entities` + filesystem mtime on `/vault/<tenant>/wiki/raw/`. Auth model deferred to §3.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:55:**Dependency on v1.0:** wiki API live + `decision_log` populated per ADR-002 §3 Decision 3 + extended phase enum per `sequencing-target.md` §6.5.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:92:**Dependency on v1.0:** `wiki-find.sh` shipped in v1.1 itself (the wrapper isn't a v1.0 deliverable per ADR-003 §"Decision 3" wrapper table); `decision_log` + `entities` populated in v1.0.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:142:- **`psql` against Postgres `decision_log`** for escalation review + audit trail — direct SQL queries, no UI layer.
docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md:152:- **`decision_log` audit trail** if asked — `psql` query showing per-agent decisions over time.

docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:21:The subsequent design pass (`docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md`) went further. Q1.4 found that **no IFOS agent calls `kb-*`** — the IFOS Agent Bundle v2 (master brief §8.1) has no `MEMORY.md`, no heartbeat memory file, and uses Postgres `decision_log` for the persistence role cortextOS's KB fills. The §3.4 seam was designed to shadow calls our agents don't make. Q3 evaluated three interface options against the post-design constraints (§3.2 rubric) and recommended Option α — a parallel `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` surface with no shadowing of cortextOS's bus.

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:63:**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:69:**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:101:**Unfreeze criterion:** Strategic review by Founder + Jack within 2 weeks of PAUSE activation produces one of three outcomes:
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:111:**Owner:** IFOS oncall + tenant operator. Daily check via `decision_log` queries: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_log WHERE phase='gating_failed' AND payload->>'tier'='red' AND payload->>'block_reason'='red_tier_classification' AND tenant_slug=? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:121:**Threshold:** Cost-per-completed-action (defined as: total IFOS infrastructure + API + Claude inference cost ÷ count of `decision_log` rows with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier IN ('green','yellow','orange-approved')`) exceeds **£0.50 per action** after 4 tenant-weeks of operation.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:176:**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:235:**Must-fill before first pilot LOI signs.** The pilot agreement may reference an external advisor for dispute resolution per `autosend-safety-policy.md` §10 placeholder language. Founder identifies and engages within Weeks 1-2.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:247:### §3.6 — Pre-pilot phase (Weeks 1-2 before first LOI)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:249:In the pre-pilot phase (before any signed LOI), all authority and consultation rules above hold, but the **consultation timing windows can compress to "next reasonable opportunity"** rather than the 24h/48h defaults. Rationale: no pilot commitments yet; reversibility is high; speed of decision matters more than process compliance.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:251:### §3.7 — Post-pilot phase (after first LOI signed)

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:14:> The document claims Week-1 implementation can proceed before the auth path is cleared. Lines 57-72 list commercial blockers for Sub-decisions A/B, but line 95 says those can remain Proposed without blocking Week-1 implementation. That weakens the Day-7 auth-path quality gate. Fix by making Bullhorn connector scaffolding explicitly conditional on A/B resolution or by narrowing Week-1 work to non-auth code only.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:16:1. **Postgres RLS** is the structural last line of defence. If application code forgets to filter by tenant_slug, RLS still blocks cross-reads at the database engine level.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:24:- **Tenant-data tables** (9 in v0.2): `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`, `tenant_eval_sets`, `tenant_adapters`, `voice_corpus`, `voice_corpus_chunks`, `tone_rule`, `recent_edit`. All have `tenant_slug` column + RLS policy.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:33:### T1 — Every tenant-data table has `tenant_slug TEXT NOT NULL`
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:35:- **Definition:** Every row in every tenant-data table carries a non-null `tenant_slug` identifying which tenant the row belongs to.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:36:- **Enforcement:** Migration SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement uses `tenant_slug TEXT NOT NULL` (no DEFAULT, no nullable).
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:38:- **Subtle case:** `recent_edit.original_text` was originally `TEXT NOT NULL` in v0.2; v0.3 (post Round-2 remediation) drops that NOT NULL constraint to allow PII purge to set `original_text=NULL`. This does not weaken T1: `recent_edit.tenant_slug` remains `TEXT NOT NULL`.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:88:- **Definition:** The two audit tables (`decision_log` from Day-4 + `recent_edit` from v0.2) are structurally append-only. Even if app code attempted DELETE, the role lacks permission.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:32:- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:40:**Week 3 needs a starting agent.** The renderer (ADR-003) lands Week 1-2; `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` land Week 1-2; Postgres `decision_log` lands Day 4 Week 0. By Week 3 the substrate is live and waiting for its first user. Without §A (first agent), Week 3 doesn't have a build target.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.

Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6).

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:21:**Sub-decision B — OAuth flow.** Master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 pre-states a recommendation: "browser dance for production, service-account for dev." This is the authorization-code grant (per-tenant browser dance, refresh-token cycle) for production tenants, plus client-credentials grant (service account) for IFOS-internal sandbox/dev work. Sub-decision B verifies that recommendation against Bullhorn's actual OAuth implementation and pins the per-tenant token storage path (per `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution: `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`, mode `0600`).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:149:- **Per-tenant model.** Each tenant has its own `corpToken` and its own per-tenant `restUrl` returned by /login. Operations are scoped by the corpToken; IFOS must hold per-tenant token state. This maps cleanly to the per-tenant credential model already pinned in `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution (`/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`, mode `0600`).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:224:This rotation pattern matters operationally: IFOS must persist the **most recent** refresh_token after every token refresh, atomically overwriting the previous one in `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`. A failure between obtaining the new refresh_token and persisting it permanently invalidates the previous one — the tenant admin must re-run the browser dance. **Spec gap §3.1-A:** the renderer + auth module need a refresh-token-persistence atomicity protocol. Recommended resolution: write to `_secrets.env.tmp` then rename, matching the atomic write pattern in `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.4.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:250:- **Production tenants:** authorization-code grant per §3.1. Per-tenant admin runs the browser dance during onboarding wizard Day 2 (Product Spec §5.2 OAuth + vault provisioning step). Refresh tokens persisted at `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env` mode 0600 with atomic-rename rotation per Spec gap §3.1-A resolution.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:271:**Status: Proposed.** Status flips to Accepted on commercial verification answers to the four questions above. Most likely outcome: confirmation of the §3.4 recommendation as stated, with one or two clarifications absorbed into the renderer's auth-module implementation.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:317:Restated from `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §2.1 + §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution + §3.1 of this document:

After reading **only `kb-setup.sh`**, the substrate of cortextOS's KB became clear, and that substrate is incompatible with the IFOS wiki data model in master brief §5.

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:55:Side effects allowed. The action proceeds immediately. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='yellow'` is written. Additionally, a sampling check fires (1-in-N per `action_type`; default N=10). On sampling, the action is enqueued for **human spot-check review** by the tenant operator within 24 hours of execution. Spot-check disagreement triggers retrospective review of the policy tier classification (potential tier elevation via tenant override).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:61:Side effects blocked at agent layer. The agent halts at `hh_decision_action` invocation. A `decision_log` row with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier='orange'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` fires (see §5). The cortextOS approval gate (primitive 4 per master brief §2.4) opens, Telegram bot notifies the tenant's designated approver (primitive 5), agent blocks until human resolves with `approve` / `reject` / `escalate-up`. Approval grants single-execution authority for the specific action_type + target + payload_hash — not a standing authorisation.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:67:Side effects refused. Agent does not get the chance to invoke. `decision_log` row with `phase='gating_failed'` and `payload.tier='red'` is written. `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` fires (see §5).

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:597:| 2 | Policy file format — YAML in vault per tenant, mirrored to Postgres for query? Or single YAML at repo root + tenant overrides in DB? | §4 + §8 | Recommend single repo-root YAML (`agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`) + tenant_adapters override layer. ADR-005 confirms. |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:600:| 5 | Spot-check sampling rate for yellow tier — what's N? Default 1-in-10, but variable by action_type. | §2 + §8 | Recommend defaults per action_type in autosend-policy.yaml; tenant overrides within range 1-in-100 to 1-in-2. |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:603:| 8 | Spot-check disagreement feedback loop — what's the mechanism for spot-check reviewer disagreement to elevate an action_type's tier? | §2 + §11 | Recommend a `spot_check_disagreement` table; >3 disagreements over 30 days triggers a tier-elevation proposal that goes through Codex ratification. v1.1 builds this. |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:611:- **Whether decision_log captures both allowed and blocked sends:** Yes, §7.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:621:- **Q5 (sampling rate defaults for yellow tier):** ACCEPTED for v1.0 with explicit operational-guess flag. Real sampling rates need pilot data; current defaults (1-in-5 to 1-in-20 per `action_type` in §3) are operational guesses calibrated by analogy to typical CRM audit-sampling practice. Refinement happens once first pilot generates 4+ tenant-weeks of yellow-tier action volume.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:624:Remaining open questions (Q1 action_type enum format, Q2 policy file format, Q4 multi-recipient batching, Q7 policy version pinning, Q8 spot-check disagreement feedback, Q9 cross-action coupling, Q10 Telegram SLA instrumentation) deferred for ADR-005 + Week-1+ work.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:634:**For Week 3-4 (Diagnostic agent build).** Diagnostic's `tools.yaml` will declare 3 action_types: `diagnostic_report_render` (green), `diagnostic_email_send` (orange — falls back to ad-hoc Telegram approval at v1.0 per §9 + §11 question 6), `diagnostic_calendar_invite` (orange — same).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:636:**For Week 5-13 (Janitor → Concierge).** Each agent's `tools.yaml` declares its action_types. The renderer per ADR-003 §4 validates declarations against this policy. Bullhorn-integration-path §4.1 + §6.3's Concierge Note auto-send sensitivity ("notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI") is materially mitigated: the canonical orange example in §3 ensures every Concierge Note write goes through approval at v1.0 (ad-hoc) and v1.1+ (policy-driven).

Claude Code's hooks convention is `.claude/hooks/*.sh`; cortextOS templates don't use that path (they use `.claude/skills/` for skill scripts but not `.claude/hooks/` for lifecycle hooks). Recommended resolution in §2.1: render the two scripts to `.claude/hooks/` so they integrate with Claude Code's hook discovery; CLAUDE.md preamble (synthesised from agent.md per §2.1) references them by name.

docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:115:Seven phases. Each has a goal, a checklist of artifacts, and a "done when" criterion. For each artifact: purpose, dependency, estimated effort (C = Claude session count, a single focused session), and a suggested prompt to generate it.
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:352:  - *Prompt:* "Write the Agents View Specification: the list layout, per-agent detail page (config editor with diff-view vs template defaults, run history with outcome filters, cost trend chart, test-run button with sandbox execution, version pinning UI, pause/resume controls), changes-require-approval flow when editing config."
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:472:  - *Prompt:* "Write the Case Study Template: structure for future case studies (problem, before-state, the implementation, results in numbers, client quote, duration, agents-enabled, outcome hero). Written to be filled in within 90 minutes of a 1-hour founding customer interview."
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:494:  - *Prompt:* "Write the IntelForce AI OS Support Playbook: the 20 most likely client support tickets (agent produced bad output, integration disconnected, can't log in, need user added, billing question, want to pause agent, want to rename agent, want new capability, approval queue stuck, question about a log entry, invoice dispute, want to downgrade, want to upgrade, data export request, GDPR DSAR, cancellation request, 'it's not working' vague, hallucination complaint, proposal draft was wrong, voice is drifting). Per ticket: diagnostic questions, resolution steps, escalation path, expected resolution time, template response."
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:503:  - *Prompt:* "Write the Monitoring & Alert Playbook: every alert the observability stack fires, with for each: the condition that triggers it, the likely root causes, the diagnostic commands, the resolution steps, the escalation rules. Organise by severity tier."
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:541:  - *Prompt:* "Write the Voice Receptionist Full Specification: the Vapi platform configuration (assistants, tools, actions), the pre-call context injection (practice info, FAQs, protocols), the in-call escalation triggers, the post-call Claude Code agent that processes the call outcome, the Calendly/Cal.com booking flow, the FAQ training pipeline, the edge cases (accents, complaints, emergencies, out-of-hours), the testing framework (100+ test calls before launch)."
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:575:Then work **phases in strict order.** Phase 2 cannot start productively before Phase 1 proves the runtime. Phase 3 can't be finalised without Phase 2's agents being real.
docs/_supplementary/execution-plan.md:577:Within a phase, order items by the dependency markers. 1.1 before 1.4 before 1.6. Unblock parallel tracks where the *Depends on* line has nothing upstream.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:396:**Rename-safety mechanism** (recommended): the `update-entity` operation, when the `display_name` field changes, triggers a `rewrite-backlinks` job that walks all pages with this entity in `linked_entities` and replaces the link text. The stable anchor is the `id` field — backlinks resolution always goes via id, not display name. The on-disk markdown is the human-facing artefact; the Postgres `entity_graph` table holds the id-based relationship truth.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:398:**Spec gap 2.2-A:** master brief §5 does not specify the rewrite-backlinks mechanism. Recommended resolution: implement as part of `update-entity` in `packages/brain/wiki/lib/update.ts` v1.0.

The `entity-history` operation reads from the Postgres `decision_log` table, **not** from a separate per-entity history file. This is why the master brief's `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 is a spec gap (2.1-B) — there are two candidates for "where history lives" and only one of them is in the master brief.

Query: `SELECT id, display_name FROM entities WHERE tenant_slug = $1 AND entity_type = $2 AND display_name % $3 ORDER BY similarity(display_name, $3) DESC LIMIT 10;`. Sub-second on tables up to ~10M rows; the 100-customer × ~50k-candidates-each scale of v1.0 fits comfortably.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:700:- Postgres update uses optimistic concurrency: `UPDATE entities SET frontmatter = $1, updated_at = now() WHERE tenant_slug = $2 AND id = $3 AND updated_at = $4` — `$4` is the `updated_at` value the agent read at the start of the operation. If the row count is zero, another agent committed in between; the operation re-reads, re-applies its change, and retries (max 3 times).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:712:- No corruption; both changes land; decision_log captures both `hh_decision_output` rows separately.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:727:**Spec gap 2.6:** none of this is in the master brief. **Recommended resolution:** adopt the mechanism above verbatim; document in a `docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` companion file in Week 1 (before agent code starts). **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — concurrency code is a v1.0 build artefact, not a Week 0 prerequisite, but the design needs to land before the first multi-agent test in week 5.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:782:**Decision-log volume:** every agent run produces 1-3 `decision_log` rows (`hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, optionally `hh_decision_action` when human responds). At 6 v1.0 agents × ~10 runs/agent/day × 3 tenants × 3 rows = ~540 rows/day per shared Postgres instance. Trivial volume; the table needs hash partitioning (per Ultraplan §5.1) primarily for query performance at v1.2+ scale, not v1.0 write throughput.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:870:Concurrency mechanisms live inside the server process. Audit logging via decision_log + an internal request log. Tenant scoping validated at server entry: the `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` from the agent's environment is the authoritative tenant; any tool call carrying a mismatched `tenant_slug` is rejected before reaching the library.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:889:| **Audit-loggability** — every read/write reaches `decision_log` + Codex review (master brief §8.1 + §10.5) | Each wrapper's CLI handler calls `hh_decision_trigger` / `hh_decision_output` directly before returning. Same pattern as cortextOS's 47 bus wrappers (e.g. `bus/send-message.sh` writes via `bus/message.ts`). One audit-log call site per op. | Server-internal request logger writes one row per tool invocation. Centralised — one log site for all 12 ops. But the log site lives in a separate process; correlation with the agent's `agent_run_id` requires passing it on every tool call. | Library writes audit row when called. Same library code as α/β, just invoked from a skill-instigated `node -e` or wrapper. Audit-log correctness depends on the skill documentation reminding the agent to pass `agent_run_id` — fragile. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:890:| **Multi-tenancy enforcement** — how `tenant_slug` is validated at the entry point (master brief §3.5) | Wrapper reads `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` env var (set by PM2 ecosystem per-tenant process group); CLI handler validates that the arg `--tenant` matches the env or fails with `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK`. Kernel-enforced isolation underneath (POSIX 0700 per Ultraplan §5.1) means a wrong tenant fails at filesystem read. | Server receives `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` at connection setup via MCP server args; rejects any tool call whose `tenant_slug` mismatches the connection identity. Filesystem isolation underneath same as α. One enforcement site. | Library validates `tenant_slug` against env var. Same enforcement model as α, but agent-side discipline depends on skill docs being followed. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:921:- **v2.0 LoRA scale (master brief §5.5):** the LoRA pipeline operates on the `decision_log` table, not on the wiki. Wiki ops from LoRA-enhanced agents are unchanged. Both options work.

Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view from master brief §6 Day 3) is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:949:2. **Companion document `docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` (Spec gap 2.6 resolution).** Documents the concurrency mechanism so concurrency code in `wiki/lib/concurrency.ts` is reviewable. **Week 1-2.**

RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.

   269	### Open questions for founder review
   270	
   271	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   272	|---|---|---|
   273	| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
   274	| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
   275	| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
   276	| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
   277	| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
   278	| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |
   279	
   280	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
   281	
   282	1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
   283	2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
   284	3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.
   285

   287	
   288	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   289	
   290	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill: this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.
   291	
   292	Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
   293	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   294	- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
   295	- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer
   296	
   297	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   298	- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   299	- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   300	- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
   301	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)
   302	
   303	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:98:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:110:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:111:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:126:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:129:**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:200:**Cost if deferred risk materialises late:** if Bullhorn webhook coverage is worse than expected (Risk #2 secondary), Concierge polling cadence increases (per Day 2 §4.2 fallback) — connector-internal change, no agent rework. Bounded.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:253:| 2. Substrate exercise (sequential build-up) | **Wins** — each agent extends the substrate of the prior (renderer → Bullhorn auth → voice → Tier-1 primitives → multi-source → full Tier-1 lifecycle) | Loses — Concierge has to build its own Bullhorn auth + voice substrate inline | Loses — Concierge built before its substrate dependencies (Scribe's Notes-for-context not yet available) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:282:| 2 | W5 | **Janitor** (A2) | First Bullhorn auth + downstream-pattern-setter (Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge inherit) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:300:**Trigger 1 — Risk #2 materialises in Week 4-5.** If Bullhorn auth path breaks (Day 2 Sub-decisions A or B don't flip to Accepted, marketplace required but unobtainable, OAuth flow blocks deployment, or per-tenant client_id ticket cycle slows past 5 business days per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 row 5):
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:304:- **Updates required:** `.agents/current-priorities.md` open list; this document's §4.1 table; master brief §8.2 (atomic correction commit edit, joining the 7-edit manifest); `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risk #2 row.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:327:- Janitor-before-Scribe-before-Concierge dependency chain (Bullhorn auth + voice substrate must land in that order).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:360:| **Janitor → Scribe** | **5 nightly-sweep cycles across 2+ tenants** (one tenant week-1 + one tenant week-2 + 3 sweep nights minimum) | Bullhorn auth refresh-loop tested across at least 3 access-token-TTL boundaries (i.e. 30+ minutes of operation per cycle); rate-limit budget verified ≤ §4.4-allocation from `bullhorn-integration-path.md`; `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` never fires; day-30 before/after report template renders per Product Spec §2.2 R9 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:373:3. **Either fix-and-retry (1 additional week)** or **scope-cut contingency activates** per §4.3 Trigger 1 (if Risk #2 derived) or §4.3 Trigger 2 (if Risk #4 derived).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:406:### 6.3 — For Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:439:- **Janitor's first Bullhorn auth refresh fails by W5** (Risk #2 unmitigated; commercial path broken)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:449:- §4.3 revisit conditions name specific tripwires (Risk #2, Risk #4, Hire #1) and concrete activation actions (decider + updates required + cascade).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:490:| Sequencing target | §4.1 | Master brief §8.2 sequence ratified verbatim: Diagnostic W3-4 → Janitor W5 → Scribe W6 → Cash Conductor W7-8 → Sourcing Scout W9 → Concierge W10-13 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:491:| Revisit conditions | §4.3 | Three triggers named (Risk #2, Risk #4, Hire #1) with decider + activation + updates + cascade per trigger |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:508:| Day 2 commercial conversations land by start of W4 (Risk #2 reduction triggers) | Founder | Sunday-Monday outreach; resolved by end of W3 | Already tracked from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:11:| 2 | Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week | ~~High~~ → Medium (blast-radius reduced) | High | End of week 3 status not "core read endpoints working" | Week 0 Day 2 on Bullhorn auth research; contingency: defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8 | **Updated Day 13 (2026-05-24):** **Blast radius reduced** by ADR-005 (`docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md`). Bullhorn-touching agents (Janitor W5+) gated on A+B response or 2026-06-10 force-fallback. Bullhorn partnership form submitted 2026-05-24 via verified Marketo form at `https://www.bullhorn.com/become-a-partner/` (response 2-5 business days). Diagnostic shipped Day 13 without Bullhorn dependency — 4 of 6 v1.0 agents no longer blocked on this risk. Sub-decisions A (marketplace vs direct) and B (OAuth flow) remain **Proposed**. **Reduction trigger 1 (Medium → Low):** A and B flip to Accepted when commercial answers land. **Reduction trigger 2 (Low → Closed):** first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Janitor agent build (master brief §12 tripwire "core read endpoints working" passes). |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:60:- 2026-05-16 (Day 2) — Risk #2 status entry updated: Sub-decision C **Accepted** per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4 + §5; Sub-decisions A and B **Proposed** with named reduction triggers (Sunday/Monday commercial conversations). Two staged severity reductions specified (High → Medium on commercial answers; Medium → Low on first Week 3-4 Bullhorn write landing clean). Risk #7 edit count revised from 5 to 6 (Bullhorn decision §6.6 sixth edit added — master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 `service-account for dev` correction). No new risks surfaced from Day 2 — Sub-decisions A and B Proposed is the intended honest state pending commercial verification, not a new risk surface.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:64:- 2026-05-18 (Day 5) — **Day 5 decision artefacts shipped: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` + `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` (both Status: Proposed).** Auto-send safety policy specifies 4-tier traffic light (green/yellow/orange/red), `hh_decision_action` integration per ADR-003 §2.1, 3 new `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` codes (`ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`), pilot-agreement liability placeholder (legal review required before first LOI), v1.0 ships green+red only / yellow+orange phased to v1.1. Kill criterion specifies 10 binary triggers spanning design-partner gap (Trigger 1 = Week-3 PAUSE), renderer build (Trigger 2 = W3 KILL), Bullhorn auth (Trigger 3 = W5 PIVOT), scope cuts (Trigger 4 from sequencing-target §6.6), autosend miscategorisations (Trigger 5), unit economics + infra cost (Triggers 6+7 = PIVOT), Gate B revenue (Trigger 8 = KILL per master brief example), cortextOS primitive stability (Trigger 9), PII leakage (Trigger 10 = unilateral KILL). **Risk #3 escalated from Medium to High** — zero design partners in pipeline as of Day 5; original "conversation 1" assumption invalidated. **Risk #7 edit count revised from 9 to 10** with new Edit 10 (master brief §6 Day 5 lines 484-485 path drift `docs/` root → `docs/decisions/`). Codex Day-7 queue grows from 15 to 17 (both Day-5 artefacts).
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:604:**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).

   705	This matrix tells us the MCP-server build priority:
   706	
   707	1. **Bullhorn** — 18 of 18 agents need it (or compatible ATS). Top priority.
   708	2. **Voice loader / vault helpers** — 16 of 18. Build in week 1.
   709	3. **Telegram** — 16 of 18. Comes free with CortexOS if primitive #5 works.
   710	4. **Microsoft Graph** — 8 of 18. Second-priority MCP work.
   711	5. **Companies House** — 6 of 18. Free API, easy build.
   712	6. **LinkedIn (via Proxycurl)** — 6 of 18. Third-priority.
   713	7. **Xero / QuickBooks / Sage** — 4 of 18 (one per tenant typically). Cash Conductor's blocker.

   717	## 9. The 14-week v1.0 sprint plan
   718	
   719	Targets: 3 paid pilots by end of Q3 2026 (per the internal business plan). v1.0 = the six v1.0 agents shippable in the Starter and Boutique tiers; Growth/Scale defer to v1.1.
   720	
   721	**Assumptions baked in:**
   722	- Maddox solo for weeks 0–6; Hire #1 starts week 7 (per the most plausible reading of the user's memory, with caveat in §10).
   723	- CortexOS primitives 1, 4, 5 are working by week 0; 2, 3, 6, 7 land during the build window.
   724	- Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it.
   725	- The first pilot lands at week 10 (mid-July 2026) for a 2-week pilot, converting to paid week 12.
   726	
   727	### Week 0 — Pre-build clearance (the seven-day window from §11)
   728	
   729	| Day | Activity |
   730	|---|---|
   731	| Mon | CortexOS primitive audit; one-line status per primitive |
   732	| Tue | Decision on Bullhorn integration path (marketplace vs direct); design partner conversation 1 |
   733	| Wed | Phase 2 pattern refactor scoping (the three v2 changes) |
   734	| Thu | Postgres + Hetzner UK + LUKS volume setup |
   735	| Fri | First MCP server scoped (Bullhorn); contract review with first design partner |
   736	
   737	End-of-week-0 deliverables:
   738	- One-line status per CortexOS primitive
   739	- Signed letter-of-intent (LOI) from at least one pilot, even if non-binding
   740	- Bullhorn integration path decided and documented
   741	- Hetzner UK VPS provisioned with Postgres + LUKS volume
   742	
   743	### Weeks 1–2 — Foundation
   744	
   745	- Week 1: Agent Bundle v2 pattern refactor; `_shared/` module build; voice loader; escalation codes catalogue; vertical schema v0.1
   746	- Week 2: Tenancy plumbing (Postgres RLS, tenant provisioning scripts, PM2 ecosystem generator); backup setup; first dry-run tenant provisioned end-to-end
   747	
   748	Milestone: a tenant can be provisioned in <30 minutes by a script.
   749	
   750	### Weeks 3–4 — Bullhorn + Diagnostic
   751	
   752	- Week 3: Bullhorn MCP server build (auth, read endpoints, write endpoints, webhook subscription)
   753	- Week 4: Diagnostic agent built end-to-end; first diagnostic run against a real prospect's footprint
   754	
   755	Milestone: Diagnostic produces a 12-page audit on a real firm; sales motion has its first artefact.
   756	
   757	### Weeks 5–6 — Janitor + Scribe
   758	
   759	- Week 5: Janitor agent; day-30 before/after report template; CI fixtures
   760	- Week 6: Scribe agent; Fathom + Fireflies MCP; tacit-note taxonomy v0.1
   761	
   762	Milestone: Janitor produces an audit report against a real Bullhorn (the first pilot's, ideally). Scribe processes 10 real calls.
   763	
   764	### Weeks 7–8 — Cash Conductor + Hire #1 onboards
   765	
   766	- Week 7: Hire #1 onboards (assumed); Xero MCP + Open Banking integration
   767	- Week 8: Cash Conductor agent; chase-cadence config; tenant-level baseline DSO captured
   768	
   769	Milestone: Cash Conductor running in shadow mode against first pilot's accounting data.
   770	
   771	### Weeks 9–10 — Sourcing Scout + Concierge start
   772	
   773	- Week 9: Sourcing Scout (daytime); LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library integration
   774	- Week 10: Concierge build starts (4-week build); first pilot landed for shadow-mode trial
   775	
   776	Milestone: First pilot signed; agents running in shadow mode (drafts to a separate inbox, no auto-send).
   777	
   778	### Weeks 11–14 — Concierge completion + first pilot conversion
   779	
   780	- Weeks 11–13: Concierge build continues; Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view); auto-send graduation for Triage-eligible categories (initially Concierge-only candidate-acknowledgement)
   781	- Week 14: First pilot converts to paid; pilots 2 and 3 sales conversations active
   782	
   783	Milestone: One paying tenant at end of Q3 2026; two more in advanced sales.

   785	### Sprint review cadence
   786	
   787	- Daily standup: 15 min, async via Slack (if solo, written; if 2-person, video Mon/Wed/Fri)
   788	- Weekly review: Friday afternoon. Three questions: what shipped, what's stuck, what changed in the plan
   789	- Bi-weekly tenant check-in: with whichever pilot is most active
   790	- Monthly strategic review: re-cut sprint plan based on tenant signals
   791	
   792	### What slips first if it slips
   793	
   794	In priority order of what we cut to hit the date:
   795	
   796	1. Edge-case test fixtures beyond the minimum 3 per agent
   797	2. Brain UI polish (we use Telegram + email as the surface)
   798	3. Sovereign-tier setup (deferred to v2.0 regardless)
   799	4. Janitor's Workflow F (the day-30 before/after report) — can be manually compiled for the first tenant
   800	5. Cash Conductor's escalation-tier-3 (bad debt write-off draft) — manual until 6 months in
   801	6. Concierge's deep nurture sequence (months 12 and 24 check-ins) — can be added in v1.1
   802	
   803	What we never cut:
   804	- Agent Bundle v2 pattern compliance (Rule 3)
   805	- Decision log writes (Rule 4 — required for the LoRA pipeline later)
   806	- Voice classifier and Gate A enforcement (Rule 4)
   807	- Tenant isolation (Rule 1, §5)

   811	## 10. The risk register
   812	
   813	Ordered by probability × impact. Updated weekly during the build. The "Tripwire" column is the leading indicator we watch.
   814	
   815	| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Tripwire | Mitigation |
   816	|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   817	| 1 | CortexOS primitives 3 or 4 are flaky in production | High | High | Daily orchestrator health check flags >1 incident/week | Degraded-mode fallbacks per agent (§3.5); the file bus contract is documented and we can manually trigger handoffs if needed |
   818	| 2 | Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week | High | High | End of week 3 status not "core read endpoints working" | Pre-emptive: spend week 0 on Bullhorn auth research. Contingency: defer Janitor and Scribe to weeks 7–8, push Concierge to v1.1 |
   819	| 3 | First design partner not signed by end of week 0 | Medium | High | Week 0 ends without LOI | Sales conversations start before week 0; do NOT begin code until first LOI lands |
   820	| 4 | Hire #1 doesn't start until Q4 2026 | Medium | High | No offer accepted by end of week 4 | v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0 |
   830	| 14 | A regulatory change (a sixth JSL rule, an Acturis API change) invalidates a Temp agent's logic | Low | High | Compliance team change notification (UK Gov) | Compliance Watchtower has its own meta-agent that watches UK Gov regulatory pages weekly |
   831	
   832	Risks #1, #2, #3, #4 are the four that could kill v1.0. Everything below them is recoverable.
   833

   835	
   836	## 11. The 7-day pre-build checklist
   837	
   838	These are the questions and decisions that must be cleared before any code is written. Each has an owner and a deadline. If any are still open at end of day 7, the v1.0 build start slips by the same number of days.
   839	
   840	### Day 1 — Monday
   841	
   842	- [ ] CortexOS primitive status audit. One line per primitive: "shipped and tested" / "shipped but flaky" / "documented not built" / "aspirational". **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** `cortexos-primitive-status.md` committed to repo.
   843	- [ ] Design-partner sales conversation 1 (pilot candidate A). **Owner:** Maddox.
   844	
   845	### Day 2 — Tuesday
   846	
   847	- [ ] Bullhorn integration path decision: marketplace vs direct API. **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** decision documented in `decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`.
   848	- [ ] OAuth model decision (browser dance for production, service-account for dev). **Owner:** Maddox.
   849	- [ ] Design-partner conversation 2 (pilot candidate B). **Owner:** Maddox.
   850	
   851	### Day 3 — Wednesday
   852	
   853	- [ ] v1.0 sequence optimisation target: Maddox confirms (b) "close first 3 pilots fastest" or revises. **Owner:** Maddox.
   854	- [ ] Brain UI v1.0 scope: confirm "minimal what-did-the-agents-do-today view" or revise. **Owner:** Maddox (after at least one pilot conversation).
   855	- [ ] Hire #1 status one-liner. **Owner:** Maddox.
   856	
   857	### Day 4 — Thursday
   858	
   859	- [ ] Hetzner UK VPS provisioned; LUKS volume mounted; Postgres 16 installed; basic RLS policy template tested. **Owner:** Maddox (engineering work).
   860	- [ ] First MCP server scoped: tools.yaml schema for Bullhorn integration documented.
   861	
   862	### Day 5 — Friday
   863	
   864	- [ ] Auto-Send Safety Policy artefact drafted (Q11). **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** `auto-send-safety-policy.md`.
   865	- [ ] v1.0 kill criterion documented (Q12). **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** `v1-kill-criterion.md`.
   866	
   867	### Day 6 — Saturday (light day)
   868	
   869	- [ ] Vertical schema v0.1 draft started. **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` with the 8 core entities.
   870	
   871	### Day 7 — Sunday (review)
   872	
   873	- [ ] First design-partner LOI signed (non-binding pilot commitment). **Owner:** Maddox.
   874	- [ ] Sprint week 1 ticket-by-ticket plan written. **Owner:** Maddox.
   875	- [ ] Risk register reviewed; tripwires set for week 1. **Owner:** Maddox.
   876	
   877	End-of-week-0 review:
   878	- If ≥1 of: design-partner LOI signed + CortexOS primitives 1, 4, 5 working + Bullhorn auth working → proceed to week 1
   879	- If <1: extend pre-build by 1 week and clear the blocker
   880	
   881	This is the structural protection against building something nobody will pay for.
   882	
   883	---
   884	
   885	## 12. The single-sentence test
   886	
   887	If Maddox can't answer each of the following with a confident yes by end of week 0, the build does not start.
   888	
   889	1. Do we have at least one design partner who has said "yes I will pilot this in Q3 2026"?
   890	2. Does the CortexOS submodule give us primitives 1, 4, and 5 working today?
   891	3. Have we decided which ATS we're building against first (Bullhorn) and have we cleared the auth path?
   892	4. Have we scoped the Agent Bundle v2 refactor and is the work <5 days?
   893	5. Have we drafted the vertical schema v0.1 with the 8 core entities?
   894	
   895	If yes-yes-yes-yes-yes, week 1 starts.
   896	
   897	Otherwise, week 0 extends, and we say so honestly.
   898

REJECTED

1. Gate B is weakened from two hard thresholds into a composite score. Lines 61 and 191 set `Target ≥12.5`, which would pass cases like 25% dedup and 0% field-completeness improvement, despite ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 requiring both `≥15% dedup` and `≥10% field completeness improvement`. Fix: keep the two thresholds independent; do not use the composite as pass/fail.

2. Tacit-note harvesting mixes `decision_log` with the v0.2 `recent_edit` schema. Lines 59 and 134-136 query `decision_log` for `recent_edit` rows / `resolution='approved_after_edit'`, but `recent_edit` is a separate v0.2 table and `resolution` is its field, not a `decision_log` field. Fix: query `recent_edit` for edited drafts and join to `decision_log` only for audit/action context if needed.

3. Schema references include invented or wrong fields/anchors. Line 57 uses candidate “CRNs”, but the candidate schema defines `bullhorn_id` and no CRN field; line 70 cites `candidate.location` as line 89, but location is at schema line 124; lines 113-114 repeat wrong anchors. Fix: replace CRNs with Bullhorn IDs or IFOS entity IDs and correct all schema line citations.

4. Escalation-code semantics are repurposed. Lines 185 and 211 use `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` for confidence below threshold or activity-window blocks, but the catalogue defines it for confidence `≥0.85` human-review-required cases. Line 185 also collapses Gate A failures into `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`/`ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED`, bypassing the listed `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` and `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` cases. Fix: map each Gate A failure to the catalogue’s matching trigger, and add a new code only if no existing trigger fits.
