=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

*End of top-level SKILL.md. Apply the relevant type-specific skill next.*

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Diagnostic — the sales tool

**Status:** Proposed (Day-11 pre-W3-build draft; awaits Q1 LOI + Codex ratification at first render).
**Date:** 2026-05-22.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 row 1 (anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`.
**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1.
**Tier:** 2 (request-driven; no persistent PTY) per sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A hard-fails on any section missing its citation. (Per-claim citation validation is a W4 polish item; the v0 contract requires per-section coverage as a tractable Gate-A check.) The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### CLI (v1.0)

```bash
# Manual consultant invocation, run from anywhere
ifosctl diagnostic \
  --firm "Charterhouse Partners" \
  --sector "fintech" \                  # optional; helps tighten ICP fit scoring
  --tenant <slug>                       # which tenant's target_patch + voice corpus to use
  --notify-via telegram                 # optional; pings consultant when done
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY) → exits within 10-15 min per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 turnaround target.

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Diagnose Firm" button → triggers via internal API
- Telegram bot command (`@ifos_bot diagnose Charterhouse Partners`)
- Bulk-mode (`ifosctl diagnostic --firm-list firms.csv`) — out of v1.0 scope

---

## §3 — The 12 required sections

Every report MUST contain these 12 sections in order. Gate A enforces section count + per-section citation.

| # | Section | What it contains | Source(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Firm signal** | Companies House data: registered name, company number, incorporation date, latest filed accounts (revenue band + headcount band), registered office, recent director changes, share-class moves | Companies House API |
| 2 | **Online footprint** | Primary website URL + last-updated signal; LinkedIn company page URL + follower count + last-post recency; careers page URL + state (active / placeholder / 404) | Web scraper (HEAD + first 200 lines); LinkedIn company-page fetch |
| 3 | **Sector + role-type mix** | Sectors actively recruiting for (extracted from current job posts); ratio of permanent vs contract roles in last 90 days; technical-vs-commercial-vs-operational split | LinkedIn job posts + careers page job listings |
| 4 | **Geography** | Office locations + current hiring locations + remote-vs-onsite-vs-hybrid mix | LinkedIn job posts (location field) + Companies House registered office |
| 5 | **Deal-size band proxy** | Salary bands or day-rate ranges visible in job posts; level distribution (junior / mid / senior / executive); recent placements visible via LinkedIn employees-of-firm field changes | LinkedIn job posts + LinkedIn employee timeline scan |
| 6 | **ICP fit vs target_patch** | Score 0-100 against tenant's `target_patch.json` (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band_gbp from `common-target-patch.json`). Includes named matches/mismatches per dimension | Tenant config + sections 1-5 above |
| 7 | **Tech stack signals** | Technologies named in JDs + LinkedIn skills aggregated from current employees + tools mentioned in director posts | LinkedIn JDs + LinkedIn employee profiles |
| 8 | **Pain signals** | Phrases on careers page suggesting urgency ("rapid growth", "we're scaling fast", "looking to triple the team"); LinkedIn director posts mentioning hiring pressure or "we need help"; Glassdoor reviews mentioning workload/burnout (if accessible) | Careers page scrape + LinkedIn director post search + optional Glassdoor scrape |
| 9 | **Competitor positioning** | Other recruitment firms visible in the candidate flow: LinkedIn employee profiles showing previous-employer agency names; @firm tags in LinkedIn recruitment-agency posts; LinkedIn "Who's hiring this firm" inference where visible | LinkedIn profile scrapes + agency-tag search |
| 10 | **Recent activity** | LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + summary); press releases or news mentions (basic Google search); funding events visible on Companies House (share allotments, new director appointments) | LinkedIn company page + Google web search + Companies House filing history |
| 11 | **Decision-maker map** | Named people likely to be buyers: head of talent / chief people officer / hiring manager equivalents. LinkedIn profile URL per person. Tenure at firm. Recent activity. | LinkedIn employee search filtered by title |
| 12 | **Conversation opener** | 2-3 sentence cold outreach pitch. Tailored to surfaced pain signals (§8). Written in consultant's voice (voice-classified). Includes specific evidence anchor (e.g., "I noticed you've doubled engineering headcount in 6 months based on your LinkedIn — congrats on the Series A. Curious how you're handling sourcing pressure at that pace.") | LLM-generated; voice-classified against tenant style guide |

**Gate A hard-fails:**

- Fewer than 12 sections present
- Any section with zero citation links
- Section 12 (conversation opener) failing voice-classifier with score < 0.75
- Output exceeds 2000 words OR is under 400 words (length-discipline boundary)

---

## §4 — Workflow

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every workflow step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start — invocation arrives via CLI ifosctl diagnostic
   → context.sh hydrates: voice corpus + tone rules + recent edits + target_patch.json
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", firm_name + sector_hint)

1. Validate input
   → validate.sh checks: firm name non-empty, sector (if provided) in known list,
     tenant_slug present, voice corpus reachable
   → Gate A: hard-fail if any check fails
   → ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL if firm name malformed (new code added to catalogue this round)

2. Companies House lookup (Section 1)
   → companies_house_lookup(firm_name) via Companies House MCP connector
   → cache result for 7 days per gotcha §6 (rate-limit discipline)
   → extract: registration + revenue band + headcount band + directors + share moves
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Companies House returns 429 (back off 60s, retry once)

3. Online footprint discovery (Section 2)
   → web HEAD + first 200 lines fetch on probable URLs:
     {firm}.com / {firm}.co.uk / linkedin.com/company/{slug}
   → LinkedIn company-page fetch (Proxycurl or similar)
   → record careers page state + last-updated signal

4. Job posts harvest (Sections 3 + 4 + 5 + 7)
   → LinkedIn job posts API (filtered to firm) — up to 50 most recent
   → careers page scrape if accessible
   → extract: sector, role type, location, salary band, tech stack
   → Gotcha §6: store summarised data only; do not retain raw profiles per LinkedIn ToS

5. Director + employee scan (Sections 7 + 11)
   → LinkedIn search for {firm} employees with titles matching head-of-talent / chro / chief people / hiring-manager / talent-acquisition variants
   → record name + URL + tenure + recent activity
   → max 10 named people; deduplicate

6. Pain signal extraction (Section 8)
   → regex pass over careers-page + LinkedIn director posts for:
     - urgency phrases ("rapid growth", "scaling fast", "we need", "tripling", "doubling")
     - frustration phrases (Glassdoor if accessible: "overworked", "burnout", "no support")
     - hiring-pressure phrases ("desperately seeking", "high-priority hire", "must hire by")
   → record each match with quote + source URL + context

7. ICP fit scoring (Section 6)
   → load tenant target_patch from common-target-patch.json
   → score each dimension (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band)
   → composite score 0-100 + per-dimension breakdown
   → no external action; compute only

8. Recent activity scan (Section 10)
   → LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + first 100 chars of each)
   → basic Google search for "{firm} announcement OR funding OR acquisition" last 90 days
   → Companies House filing history last 90 days

9. Conversation opener generation (Section 12)
   → LLM prompt: context = §1-§11 of the report (esp. §8 pain signals);
                 constraint = consultant voice (hh_load_voice_samples for top-5 ANN match);
                 constraint = tone rules (hh_load_tone_rules)
   → output 2-3 sentences with at least one evidence anchor
   → voice classifier scores the output against tenant style guide
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score < 0.75 after 3 retries

10. Markdown report assembly
    → render report from sections 1-12 using Diagnostic-specific template
    → write to /vault/{tenant_slug}/diagnostic-reports/{firm-slug}-{ISO-date}.md
    → hh_decision_output("diagnostic_report", "<path>", "12-section report on {firm}")

11. Operator notification (optional, per --notify-via flag)
    → if telegram: send via primitive 5 with report path + executive summary (first 200 chars)
      → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "operator:{chat_id}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
      → action tier per autosend-policy.yaml: green (operator-only Telegram; no customer-facing comms)
    → if no flag: silent completion (consultant checks vault) — no decision-log row needed

12. Session close

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.

- All 12 sections present in the assembled report (count + heading check) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- Every section has ≥ 1 markdown link (regex `\[.+\]\(.+\)` per section) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3) — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if voice-classifier URL unreachable; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
- Report length 400-2000 words — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- No banned phrases per `tone_rule` table (`hh_load_tone_rules` filter) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if firm-domain whitelist absent; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.

Gate B is a local leading metric for Diagnostic quality; it does NOT feed any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger directly. (Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3 at `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md`: kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion. A separate agent-specific Trigger 11 may be added in v1.1 if conversion-driven scope cuts become operationally relevant.) Below 30% sustained for 4 weeks → revisit Diagnostic's output quality at next Sunday review.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Diagnostic uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Section 12 voice classifier < 0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Companies House or LinkedIn 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL` | Malformed firm name input (Step 1 validation) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Section count != 12 OR Gate-A per-section citation missing | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` | (not Diagnostic's concern; renderer escalation only) | — | — |

Diagnostic does NOT use:

- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)
- `ESC_VAULT_*` — Diagnostic writes to one file per invocation; no concurrent-write contention

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Section 12 (conversation opener) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `diagnostic`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "I hope this finds you well" or other generic openers
  - No salary or commission anchors in cold outreach
  - Specific evidence anchor required (not generic "great company")
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant's voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks closest to current task context (cold-outreach-to-recruitment-firm-decision-maker). Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the §12 voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires per `escalation-codes.md` ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT trigger — ≥5 `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7-day window (per the nightly voice-drift cron). Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT directly.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §8 — Build dependencies (W3 prerequisites)

Diagnostic build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 commits | ✅ Ratified (Round 3) |
| Live VPS migration applied | `bash scripts/run-live-migration.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Tenancy audit passes 12 invariants | `bash scripts/run-tenancy-audit.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Q1 design partner LOI signed | Risk #3 + kill-criterion §2 Trigger 1 | ⏸ Jack's lane |
| `target_patch.json` for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI (per tenant-lifecycle.md §2) |
| Voice corpus seeded for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Companies House MCP connector | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| LinkedIn read-only MCP connector (or Proxycurl wrapper) | Build at W3 start (~2 days) | ⏸ Not built |
| Web scraper utility (HEAD + first-N-lines) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic (12-section check) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs (01-primary + 02-edge-case-no-online-footprint + 99-voice-drift-canary) | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| Codex ratification of full agent bundle | Post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill | ✅ Skill built Day 19 (`.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md`) |

**Until ALL ratified items have ⏸ → ✅, W3 build slice does not start.**

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + first pilot tenant onboarded + W3 build slice start.

**Recommended ratification path:** Author the agent.md draft (this document) Day 11 — frees W3 build to focus on the other 5 bundle files + 3 fixtures, not iterating on output contract under W3 deadline pressure. Founder reviews this draft when convenient; refinements drop in commits between Day 11 and W3 start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
| Q2 | Should §11 (decision-maker map) be a separate section OR rolled into §3 + §4 + §5 + §7 as a sub-row? Currently named as a separate section. | Founder review at agent.md ratification. |
| Q3 | Proxycurl vs alternative LinkedIn API surface? Cost + ToS implications. | Resolved at W3 start before Companies House + LinkedIn MCP connectors authored. Founder + Claude decide together. |
| Q4 | Gate B (30% discovery-call-to-report ratio) measured how? Manual tagging by consultant OR auto-detection via Bullhorn calendar links? | v1.0 manual tagging via Telegram resolution; v1.1 auto-detection. |
| Q5 | What's the "firm-slug" canonical form for the output filename? Companies House registration number? URL-slugified firm name? | Recommend Companies House number for stability; canonical-slug fallback for non-UK firms (v1.1+). |
| Q6 | Should §10 (recent activity) include Glassdoor reviews? ToS implications. | Per gotcha §6 below: caution; default OFF for v1.0; explicit founder enable for v1.1+. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)

1. **LinkedIn ToS — cannot store profile data beyond the audit.** Profile fetches are cached only for the duration of the report generation (typ. 10-15 min). After report writes to vault, raw profile data is dropped from agent memory + no persistence in Postgres.
2. **Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.** Free tier is 600 requests per 5-minute window per IP. Cache responses for 7 days per (company_number) key. Pre-emptive 60s backoff on first 429.
3. **Glassdoor scraping — uncertain ToS compatibility.** Default OFF for v1.0. Per Q6 above.

---

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (skill built Day 19; commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md plus the 5 sibling bundle files plus 3 fixtures ratify as a unit at W3 build end.

Status flips to Accepted when:
- Codex Round-3+ ratifies the full bundle
- Founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical
- First production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Gate B baseline measurement begins (30% target; 4-week window)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

    12	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    13	
    14	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    15	
    16	> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A hard-fails on any section missing its citation. (Per-claim citation validation is a W4 polish item; the v0 contract requires per-section coverage as a tractable Gate-A check.) The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).

    43	## §3 — The 12 required sections
    44	
    45	Every report MUST contain these 12 sections in order. Gate A enforces section count + per-section citation.
    46	
    47	| # | Section | What it contains | Source(s) |
    48	|---|---|---|---|
    49	| 1 | **Firm signal** | Companies House data: registered name, company number, incorporation date, latest filed accounts (revenue band + headcount band), registered office, recent director changes, share-class moves | Companies House API |
    50	| 2 | **Online footprint** | Primary website URL + last-updated signal; LinkedIn company page URL + follower count + last-post recency; careers page URL + state (active / placeholder / 404) | Web scraper (HEAD + first 200 lines); LinkedIn company-page fetch |
    51	| 3 | **Sector + role-type mix** | Sectors actively recruiting for (extracted from current job posts); ratio of permanent vs contract roles in last 90 days; technical-vs-commercial-vs-operational split | LinkedIn job posts + careers page job listings |
    52	| 4 | **Geography** | Office locations + current hiring locations + remote-vs-onsite-vs-hybrid mix | LinkedIn job posts (location field) + Companies House registered office |
    53	| 5 | **Deal-size band proxy** | Salary bands or day-rate ranges visible in job posts; level distribution (junior / mid / senior / executive); recent placements visible via LinkedIn employees-of-firm field changes | LinkedIn job posts + LinkedIn employee timeline scan |
    54	| 6 | **ICP fit vs target_patch** | Score 0-100 against tenant's `target_patch.json` (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band_gbp from `common-target-patch.json`). Includes named matches/mismatches per dimension | Tenant config + sections 1-5 above |
    55	| 7 | **Tech stack signals** | Technologies named in JDs + LinkedIn skills aggregated from current employees + tools mentioned in director posts | LinkedIn JDs + LinkedIn employee profiles |
    56	| 8 | **Pain signals** | Phrases on careers page suggesting urgency ("rapid growth", "we're scaling fast", "looking to triple the team"); LinkedIn director posts mentioning hiring pressure or "we need help"; Glassdoor reviews mentioning workload/burnout (if accessible) | Careers page scrape + LinkedIn director post search + optional Glassdoor scrape |
    57	| 9 | **Competitor positioning** | Other recruitment firms visible in the candidate flow: LinkedIn employee profiles showing previous-employer agency names; @firm tags in LinkedIn recruitment-agency posts; LinkedIn "Who's hiring this firm" inference where visible | LinkedIn profile scrapes + agency-tag search |
    58	| 10 | **Recent activity** | LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + summary); press releases or news mentions (basic Google search); funding events visible on Companies House (share allotments, new director appointments) | LinkedIn company page + Google web search + Companies House filing history |
    59	| 11 | **Decision-maker map** | Named people likely to be buyers: head of talent / chief people officer / hiring manager equivalents. LinkedIn profile URL per person. Tenure at firm. Recent activity. | LinkedIn employee search filtered by title |
    60	| 12 | **Conversation opener** | 2-3 sentence cold outreach pitch. Tailored to surfaced pain signals (§8). Written in consultant's voice (voice-classified). Includes specific evidence anchor (e.g., "I noticed you've doubled engineering headcount in 6 months based on your LinkedIn — congrats on the Series A. Curious how you're handling sourcing pressure at that pace.") | LLM-generated; voice-classified against tenant style guide |
    61	
    62	**Gate A hard-fails:**
    63	
    64	- Fewer than 12 sections present
    65	- Any section with zero citation links
    66	- Section 12 (conversation opener) failing voice-classifier with score < 0.75
    67	- Output exceeds 2000 words OR is under 400 words (length-discipline boundary)

    71	## §4 — Workflow
    72	
    73	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every workflow step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
    74	
    75	```
    76	0. Session start — invocation arrives via CLI ifosctl diagnostic
    77	   → context.sh hydrates: voice corpus + tone rules + recent edits + target_patch.json
    78	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", firm_name + sector_hint)
    79	
    80	1. Validate input
    81	   → validate.sh checks: firm name non-empty, sector (if provided) in known list,
    82	     tenant_slug present, voice corpus reachable
    83	   → Gate A: hard-fail if any check fails
    84	   → ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL if firm name malformed (new code added to catalogue this round)
    85	
    86	2. Companies House lookup (Section 1)
    87	   → companies_house_lookup(firm_name) via Companies House MCP connector
    88	   → cache result for 7 days per gotcha §6 (rate-limit discipline)
    89	   → extract: registration + revenue band + headcount band + directors + share moves
    90	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Companies House returns 429 (back off 60s, retry once)
    91	
    92	3. Online footprint discovery (Section 2)
    93	   → web HEAD + first 200 lines fetch on probable URLs:
    94	     {firm}.com / {firm}.co.uk / linkedin.com/company/{slug}
    95	   → LinkedIn company-page fetch (Proxycurl or similar)
    96	   → record careers page state + last-updated signal
    97	
    98	4. Job posts harvest (Sections 3 + 4 + 5 + 7)
    99	   → LinkedIn job posts API (filtered to firm) — up to 50 most recent
   100	   → careers page scrape if accessible
   101	   → extract: sector, role type, location, salary band, tech stack
   102	   → Gotcha §6: store summarised data only; do not retain raw profiles per LinkedIn ToS
   103	
   104	5. Director + employee scan (Sections 7 + 11)
   105	   → LinkedIn search for {firm} employees with titles matching head-of-talent / chro / chief people / hiring-manager / talent-acquisition variants
   106	   → record name + URL + tenure + recent activity
   107	   → max 10 named people; deduplicate
   108	
   109	6. Pain signal extraction (Section 8)
   110	   → regex pass over careers-page + LinkedIn director posts for:
   111	     - urgency phrases ("rapid growth", "scaling fast", "we need", "tripling", "doubling")
   112	     - frustration phrases (Glassdoor if accessible: "overworked", "burnout", "no support")
   113	     - hiring-pressure phrases ("desperately seeking", "high-priority hire", "must hire by")
   114	   → record each match with quote + source URL + context
   115	
   116	7. ICP fit scoring (Section 6)
   117	   → load tenant target_patch from common-target-patch.json
   118	   → score each dimension (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band)
   119	   → composite score 0-100 + per-dimension breakdown
   120	   → no external action; compute only
   121	
   122	8. Recent activity scan (Section 10)
   123	   → LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + first 100 chars of each)
   124	   → basic Google search for "{firm} announcement OR funding OR acquisition" last 90 days
   125	   → Companies House filing history last 90 days
   126	
   127	9. Conversation opener generation (Section 12)
   128	   → LLM prompt: context = §1-§11 of the report (esp. §8 pain signals);
   129	                 constraint = consultant voice (hh_load_voice_samples for top-5 ANN match);
   130	                 constraint = tone rules (hh_load_tone_rules)
   131	   → output 2-3 sentences with at least one evidence anchor
   132	   → voice classifier scores the output against tenant style guide
   133	   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score < 0.75 after 3 retries
   134	
   135	10. Markdown report assembly
   136	    → render report from sections 1-12 using Diagnostic-specific template
   137	    → write to /vault/{tenant_slug}/diagnostic-reports/{firm-slug}-{ISO-date}.md
   138	    → hh_decision_output("diagnostic_report", "<path>", "12-section report on {firm}")
   139	
   140	11. Operator notification (optional, per --notify-via flag)
   141	    → if telegram: send via primitive 5 with report path + executive summary (first 200 chars)
   142	      → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "operator:{chat_id}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   143	      → action tier per autosend-policy.yaml: green (operator-only Telegram; no customer-facing comms)
   144	    → if no flag: silent completion (consultant checks vault) — no decision-log row needed
   145	
   146	12. Session close
   147	    → hh_decision_action("diagnostic_report_render", "firm:{slug}", payload_hash, payload_preview)

   154	## §5 — Gates
   155	
   156	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   157	
   158	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.
   159	
   160	- All 12 sections present in the assembled report (count + heading check) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
   161	- Every section has ≥ 1 markdown link (regex `\[.+\]\(.+\)` per section) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
   162	- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3) — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if voice-classifier URL unreachable; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
   163	- Report length 400-2000 words — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
   164	- No banned phrases per `tone_rule` table (`hh_load_tone_rules` filter) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
   165	- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if firm-domain whitelist absent; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
   166	
   167	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   168	
   169	Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.
   170	
   171	Gate B is a local leading metric for Diagnostic quality; it does NOT feed any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger directly. (Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3 at `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md`: kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion. A separate agent-specific Trigger 11 may be added in v1.1 if conversion-driven scope cuts become operationally relevant.) Below 30% sustained for 4 weeks → revisit Diagnostic's output quality at next Sunday review.

   175	## §6 — Escalation codes
   176	
   177	Diagnostic uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
   178	
   179	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   180	|---|---|---|---|
   181	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Section 12 voice classifier < 0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
   182	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   183	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Companies House or LinkedIn 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
   184	| `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL` | Malformed firm name input (Step 1 validation) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   185	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Section count != 12 OR Gate-A per-section citation missing | warn | operator_chat_id |
   186	| `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` | (not Diagnostic's concern; renderer escalation only) | — | — |
   187	
   188	Diagnostic does NOT use:
   189	
   190	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
   191	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)
   192	- `ESC_VAULT_*` — Diagnostic writes to one file per invocation; no concurrent-write contention
   193	
   194	---
   195	
   196	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   197	
   198	Section 12 (conversation opener) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   199	
   200	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `diagnostic`** — surfaces rules like:
   201	  - No "I hope this finds you well" or other generic openers
   202	  - No salary or commission anchors in cold outreach
   203	  - Specific evidence anchor required (not generic "great company")
   204	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant's voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks closest to current task context (cold-outreach-to-recruitment-firm-decision-maker). Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
   205	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the §12 voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires per `escalation-codes.md` ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT trigger — ≥5 `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7-day window (per the nightly voice-drift cron). Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT directly.
   206	
   207	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
   208

   211	## §8 — Build dependencies (W3 prerequisites)
   212	
   213	Diagnostic build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:
   214	
   215	| Dependency | Source | Status |
   216	|---|---|---|
   217	| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 commits | ✅ Ratified (Round 3) |

   231	**Until ALL ratified items have ⏸ → ✅, W3 build slice does not start.**
   232	
   233	---
   234	
   235	## §9 — Status + open questions
   236	
   237	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + first pilot tenant onboarded + W3 build slice start.
   238	
   239	**Recommended ratification path:** Author the agent.md draft (this document) Day 11 — frees W3 build to focus on the other 5 bundle files + 3 fixtures, not iterating on output contract under W3 deadline pressure. Founder reviews this draft when convenient; refinements drop in commits between Day 11 and W3 start.
   240	
   241	### Open questions for founder review
   242	
   243	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   244	|---|---|---|
   245	| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
   246	| Q2 | Should §11 (decision-maker map) be a separate section OR rolled into §3 + §4 + §5 + §7 as a sub-row? Currently named as a separate section. | Founder review at agent.md ratification. |
   247	| Q3 | Proxycurl vs alternative LinkedIn API surface? Cost + ToS implications. | Resolved at W3 start before Companies House + LinkedIn MCP connectors authored. Founder + Claude decide together. |
   248	| Q4 | Gate B (30% discovery-call-to-report ratio) measured how? Manual tagging by consultant OR auto-detection via Bullhorn calendar links? | v1.0 manual tagging via Telegram resolution; v1.1 auto-detection. |
   249	| Q5 | What's the "firm-slug" canonical form for the output filename? Companies House registration number? URL-slugified firm name? | Recommend Companies House number for stability; canonical-slug fallback for non-UK firms (v1.1+). |
   250	| Q6 | Should §10 (recent activity) include Glassdoor reviews? ToS implications. | Per gotcha §6 below: caution; default OFF for v1.0; explicit founder enable for v1.1+. |
   251	
   252	### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)
   253	
   254	1. **LinkedIn ToS — cannot store profile data beyond the audit.** Profile fetches are cached only for the duration of the report generation (typ. 10-15 min). After report writes to vault, raw profile data is dropped from agent memory + no persistence in Postgres.
   255	2. **Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.** Free tier is 600 requests per 5-minute window per IP. Cache responses for 7 days per (company_number) key. Pre-emptive 60s backoff on first 429.
   256	3. **Glassdoor scraping — uncertain ToS compatibility.** Default OFF for v1.0. Per Q6 above.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:58:      Per-tenant pack of source documents that define the firm's outbound voice — emails the consultant has written, prior Bullhorn Notes, marketing copy, founder-curated style examples. Read by hh_load_voice_samples (semantic ANN retrieval against the embedded chunks). One voice_corpus per tenant; versioned so re-indexing produces a new row rather than mutating the live pack.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:113:        notes: True for the version currently served to hh_load_voice_samples. Exactly one row per tenant has `is_active=true` (enforced via partial unique index).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:120:      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:125:      Per-tenant tone constraints expressed as rules. Read by hh_load_tone_rules at session start; constraints are surfaced to the agent as part of the context-assembly bundle (master brief §9).

Distinct from `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` which is for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:309:- **Trigger:** Bullhorn REST write (POST/PUT/PATCH) returned 4xx/5xx after retry budget exhausted; distinct from auth failure (ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH) and rate-limit (ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT)

agents/_shared/README.md:108:**`hh_load_voice_samples` query vector:** shell can't generate embeddings. Callers from Python/Node MUST embed the task context first, encode to pgvector literal (e.g. `[0.123,0.456,...]`), and pass via `IFOS_VL_QUERY_VECTOR` env var before invoking. Without it, the helper falls back to the style-guide-only path.

Diagnostic bundle does not yet exist (gated on Q1 design partner LOI per Risk #3). When Diagnostic first renders cleanly at W4, severity drops to Medium. Three implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: (a) CLI-name divergence (`ifos-render-agent` standalone vs `cortextos-ifos render-agent` per ADR-003 §3.3.1; submodule read-only boundary prevents the latter); (b) `_shared/` symlink target counting error in ADR-003 §3.3.3 (spec says `../../_shared`, correct is `../../../_shared` — 3 vs 4 levels); (c) phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `cortextos-ifos list-agents` (renderer correctness unaffected; cosmetic). **Owner:** Claude Code Day 8 commit chain shipped; founder for Diagnostic-build green-light when Q1 turns YES. |

Day-12 first execution surfaced 6 distinct drifts (password, DB name, TRIGGER grant, GUC rename, missing tenants row, table ownership/RLS-bypass). | High (now historical; mitigated) | High at time of discovery — any of the 6 could have manifested at first pilot LOI as silent failure or data leak. | Future script/migration authoring without an explicit "first live execution against migration-test tenant" milestone listed in the plan. | Day-12 closed loop: live migration 24/24 + tenancy audit 24/24. Future: every new script touching live Postgres must include a verified-on-VPS milestone in its acceptance criteria, not just unit-test-layer green. Day-9 cohesion review template updated to require live verification before "foundation verified" verdict. | **Mitigated.** Discovery surfaces a class lesson: ratification at code-and-docs layer is necessary but not sufficient; live execution is the third leg. |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:61:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:64:- 2026-05-18 (Day 5) — **Day 5 decision artefacts shipped: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` + `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` (both Status: Proposed).** Auto-send safety policy specifies 4-tier traffic light (green/yellow/orange/red), `hh_decision_action` integration per ADR-003 §2.1, 3 new `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` codes (`ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`), pilot-agreement liability placeholder (legal review required before first LOI), v1.0 ships green+red only / yellow+orange phased to v1.1. Kill criterion specifies 10 binary triggers spanning design-partner gap (Trigger 1 = Week-3 PAUSE), renderer build (Trigger 2 = W3 KILL), Bullhorn auth (Trigger 3 = W5 PIVOT), scope cuts (Trigger 4 from sequencing-target §6.6), autosend miscategorisations (Trigger 5), unit economics + infra cost (Triggers 6+7 = PIVOT), Gate B revenue (Trigger 8 = KILL per master brief example), cortextOS primitive stability (Trigger 9), PII leakage (Trigger 10 = unilateral KILL). **Risk #3 escalated from Medium to High** — zero design partners in pipeline as of Day 5; original "conversation 1" assumption invalidated. **Risk #7 edit count revised from 9 to 10** with new Edit 10 (master brief §6 Day 5 lines 484-485 path drift `docs/` root → `docs/decisions/`). Codex Day-7 queue grows from 15 to 17 (both Day-5 artefacts).
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:65:- 2026-05-20 (Day 9 evening) — **Architecture + tenancy verification slice complete.** 3 commits (`5c3fa66` + `c4348aa` + this commit). 4 new artefacts: tenancy-invariants.md (Reference; 12 invariants T1-T12 single source of truth), run-tenancy-audit.sh (multi-tenant adversarial smoke), architecture-cohesion-review.md (8-artefact cohesion + 14 remediation items + 4-boundary adversarial walk), tenant-lifecycle.md (Provision/Operate/Suspend/Offboard/Migrate). All 4 master-brief §3 boundaries verified HOLD at current artefact set. 3 of 5 contradictions in the ratified artefact set RESOLVED via ADR-004 + Day-8 remediation; 1 RESOLVED via consolidation in tenancy-invariants.md; 1 OPEN pending Founder Decision D3 (PII retention). 8 implicit assumptions documented; 3 catastrophic-if-false verified empirically. No new risks added — cohesion review's 14 remediation items + lifecycle's 8 gaps are all variance bounded by existing risks (#5 renderer + #10 PII + others) or low-severity lazy specs. Foundation deemed sound for Diagnostic build conditional on founder-decision bundle (D1+D2+D3) + Codex Round 2 closure + live tenancy audit pass.

Diagnostic bundle still blocked by Risk #3 / Q1 design-partner LOI. Three ADR-003 implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: CLI-name divergence + symlink target counting error + phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `list-agents`. 4 of 11 Day-7-honest-read gaps fully closed (#1 voice schema, #2 preamble, #3 common schemas, #4 autosend policy YAML); 2 side-effect closed (#6 ESC catalogue, partial #10 phase enum); 5 explicitly deferred with named owner + trigger. **Codex Day-7 queue grows from 21 to 33 items** (12 new artefacts: 8 common-*.json + preamble + ESC catalogue + renderer scaffold + autosend YAML + hook-helpers + voice-loader + 2 test harnesses + v0.2 supplement + 2 migration SQL files). Live VPS smoke tests + Phase 5 migration execution remain pending (Path A founder action; documented in `agents/_shared/README.md §"Live integration test"` + `§"Phase 5 live migration"`). No new risks surfaced from the 5-phase slice.

Master brief fully reconciled. **Risk #7 closed for atomic-correction commit** — 11 edits batch-applied at `0e5b2b4`; only remaining items are post-Codex-ratification iterations if Codex flags any of the 11 edits or two side effects (Edit 1 col 4 reframe + Edit 4 row merge). Codex Day-7 ratification queue at 21 items + 1 commit; **execution deferred** to extension period per Option C (skills not yet built + Q1 unblocker required first). `gstack` dev-tool installed Day 7 morning (`f5d2956` + `ce4bb33`) — meta-tooling for development; not part of IFOS product per `.agents/learnings/gstack-pin.md`.

Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:4:**Date:** 2026-05-20 (Day 9 evening — pre-Diagnostic-build architecture audit).
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS. Every tenant runs the same agent fleet (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge in v1.0) against their own data, isolated from every other tenant's data. **A single cross-tenant data leak is a catastrophic failure mode** — it breaches the GDPR contract, violates pilot LOI terms, and burns customer trust. There is no "minor" cross-tenant leak.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:24:- **Tenant-data tables** (9 in v0.2): `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`, `tenant_eval_sets`, `tenant_adapters`, `voice_corpus`, `voice_corpus_chunks`, `tone_rule`, `recent_edit`. All have `tenant_slug` column + RLS policy.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:45:  Expected: 9 rows (entities, entity_links, decision_log, tenant_eval_sets, tenant_adapters, voice_corpus, voice_corpus_chunks, tone_rule, recent_edit).
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:155:- **Definition:** Each tenant has at most one active voice_corpus row. The `hh_load_voice_samples` helper queries `WHERE is_active=TRUE` and would return ambiguous results if two were active simultaneously.
docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:156:- **Enforcement:** Partial unique index in v0.2 migration §2: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX voice_corpus_one_active_per_tenant ON voice_corpus (tenant_slug) WHERE is_active=TRUE`. Postgres enforces — duplicate INSERT fails.

docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:88:| A1 | **Postgres `current_setting('app.current_tenant', TRUE)` returns NULL when unset, never empty string.** RLS predicate `tenant_slug = current_setting(...)` relies on NULL≠'anything' semantics. | Every RLS policy on every tenant-data table | If empty string is returned, an INSERT with `tenant_slug=''` could leak across tenants. Postgres docs confirm NULL behaviour; assumption holds. |
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:97:8 implicit assumptions documented. **A1, A2, A4 are catastrophic-if-false** (cross-tenant data leak). **A5, A7 are tested empirically** at current SHA + dev box. **A6, A8 are scale assumptions** that need re-verification at v1.1+.
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:149:| G3 | **`tenant_eval_sets` + `tenant_adapters` usage is unspecified.** Day-4 §6.3 creates the tables but no doc says when/how they're written. | Low (Week-4 Diagnostic eval-set dependency; lazy spec OK) | Spec follows first use — Diagnostic W4 build adds the first eval-set + the spec for it. Codex Round-1 issue #9 already flagged this. |
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:150:| G4 | **The agent runtime's `validate.sh` invocation contract is implicit.** ADR-003 §2.1 row 5 says it's a verbatim copy to `.claude/hooks/validate.sh`. But what does the runtime DO with it? Is it called before every tool use? Once per session? | Medium (every agent uses validate.sh) | Diagnostic W3 build's agent.md preamble names the invocation; pattern propagates. Add to tenant-lifecycle runbook. |
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:190:**Verdict: BOUNDARY HOLDS at current artefact set.** Future agents need automated guardrail; queue as Phase-1 extension OR `review-agent-bundle.md` skill at Diagnostic W3.
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:202:  - **A:** `recent_edit.original_text` + `edited_text` are narrative (raw text). `tone_rule.rule_text` is natural language. `voice_corpus_chunks.text_chunk` is text. **These ARE narrative content in Postgres** — but they're indexed for retrieval, not for primary storage. The vault remains the source of truth for the original docs; Postgres holds the indexable chunked + classified copy. ✓ Acceptable hybrid.
docs/architecture/architecture-cohesion-review.md:217:**Verdict: BOUNDARY HOLDS at current artefact set.** Same pattern as adapter boundary — needs automated guardrail at Diagnostic W3.

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:1:# Diagnostic — the sales tool
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:3:**Status:** Proposed (Day-11 pre-W3-build draft; awaits Q1 LOI + Codex ratification at first render).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 row 1 (anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:16:> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A hard-fails on any section missing its citation. (Per-claim citation validation is a W4 polish item; the v0 contract requires per-section coverage as a tractable Gate-A check.) The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:29:  --tenant <slug>                       # which tenant's target_patch + voice corpus to use
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:33:Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY) → exits within 10-15 min per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 turnaround target.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:43:## §3 — The 12 required sections
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:54:| 6 | **ICP fit vs target_patch** | Score 0-100 against tenant's `target_patch.json` (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band_gbp from `common-target-patch.json`). Includes named matches/mismatches per dimension | Tenant config + sections 1-5 above |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:77:   → context.sh hydrates: voice corpus + tone rules + recent edits + target_patch.json
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:84:   → ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL if firm name malformed (new code added to catalogue this round)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:90:   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Companies House returns 429 (back off 60s, retry once)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:117:   → load tenant target_patch from common-target-patch.json

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:130:                 constraint = tone rules (hh_load_tone_rules)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:133:   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score < 0.75 after 3 retries
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:136:    → render report from sections 1-12 using Diagnostic-specific template

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:147:    → hh_decision_action("diagnostic_report_render", "firm:{slug}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:158:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:162:- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3) — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if voice-classifier URL unreachable; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:164:- No banned phrases per `tone_rule` table (`hh_load_tone_rules` filter) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:165:- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if firm-domain whitelist absent; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:169:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:171:Gate B is a local leading metric for Diagnostic quality; it does NOT feed any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger directly. (Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3 at `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md`: kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion. A separate agent-specific Trigger 11 may be added in v1.1 if conversion-driven scope cuts become operationally relevant.) Below 30% sustained for 4 weeks → revisit Diagnostic's output quality at next Sunday review.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:177:Diagnostic uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:181:| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Section 12 voice classifier < 0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:182:| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:183:| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Companies House or LinkedIn 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:184:| `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL` | Malformed firm name input (Step 1 validation) | warn | operator_chat_id |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:185:| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Section count != 12 OR Gate-A per-section citation missing | warn | operator_chat_id |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:186:| `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` | (not Diagnostic's concern; renderer escalation only) | — | — |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:188:Diagnostic does NOT use:
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:190:- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:191:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:192:- `ESC_VAULT_*` — Diagnostic writes to one file per invocation; no concurrent-write contention
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:200:- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `diagnostic`** — surfaces rules like:
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:204:- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant's voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks closest to current task context (cold-outreach-to-recruitment-firm-decision-maker). Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:205:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the §12 voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires per `escalation-codes.md` ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT trigger — ≥5 `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7-day window (per the nightly voice-drift cron). Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT directly.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:211:## §8 — Build dependencies (W3 prerequisites)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:213:Diagnostic build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:231:**Until ALL ratified items have ⏸ → ✅, W3 build slice does not start.**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:237:**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + first pilot tenant onboarded + W3 build slice start.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:239:**Recommended ratification path:** Author the agent.md draft (this document) Day 11 — frees W3 build to focus on the other 5 bundle files + 3 fixtures, not iterating on output contract under W3 deadline pressure. Founder reviews this draft when convenient; refinements drop in commits between Day 11 and W3 start.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:245:| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:247:| Q3 | Proxycurl vs alternative LinkedIn API surface? Cost + ToS implications. | Resolved at W3 start before Companies House + LinkedIn MCP connectors authored. Founder + Claude decide together. |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:248:| Q4 | Gate B (30% discovery-call-to-report ratio) measured how? Manual tagging by consultant OR auto-detection via Bullhorn calendar links? | v1.0 manual tagging via Telegram resolution; v1.1 auto-detection. |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:252:### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:262:Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (skill built Day 19; commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md plus the 5 sibling bundle files plus 3 fixtures ratify as a unit at W3 build end.

agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:319:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — reserved for red-tier action attempts per catalogue line 41; Concierge has no red-tier actions. Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:321:- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` (direct firing) — that's fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Concierge fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:329:- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `concierge`** — surfaces rules like:
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:336:- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching the specific event_type (e.g., "rejection email" task context surfaces rejection-style samples).
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:337:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` agent**: drift signal. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a draft's voice classifier score is below the position-specific threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Concierge does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Concierge.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:1:# Codex disagreement — Diagnostic Gate A citation requirement + 4 follow-on findings
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:25:**Codex says:** "Line 16 says per-claim citation validation is deferred to W4 and only per-section coverage is required, but Ultraplan §8.1 A1 lines 496-497 requires 'no claims unsupported by source data.' This lowers a stated Gate A constraint."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:33:Option B — **Amend Ultraplan §8.1 A1 line 497** to read "no unsupported claims at section level" (loosens upstream to match v0 implementation).
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:41:**Codex says:** "Lines 140-142 send an optional Telegram notification, but line 73 says every step that produces output or takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*`; only Step 12 logs `diagnostic_report_render` at lines 144-146."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:43:**Disposition:** **Codex is correct.** Real bug. Step 11 sends a Telegram notification (an action with external side-effect) but doesn't emit a `decision_log` row. Mechanical fix: add `hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", ...)` call to Step 11.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:49:**Codex says:** "Line 169 claims Diagnostic's 30% discovery-call conversion feeds v1.0 kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8, but Trigger 8 lines 158-160 defines the threshold as average Gate B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:51:**My Round-4 remediation:** corrected Trigger 5 reference (which was about red-tier autosend) to Trigger 8. Codex says Trigger 8 is ALSO about revenue uplift, not Diagnostic conversion.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:53:**Founder decision needed:** Diagnostic's Gate B metric doesn't map cleanly to ANY existing kill-criterion trigger.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:55:Option A — **Remove kill-criterion reference entirely.** Just describe Gate B as a local leading metric for Diagnostic; not part of any kill-criterion trigger. Honest.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:57:Option B — **Add a new kill-criterion Trigger 11 (DIAGNOSTIC-CONVERSION-FAIL).** Threshold: <30% discovery-call rate sustained for 4 weeks across all live pilots. Owner: founder + Jack.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:59:**My recommendation:** **A** for v0 — remove the trigger reference; Diagnostic conversion is local-metric tracking. Add Trigger 11 in v1.1 if conversion-rate-driven scope-cut becomes operationally relevant.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:61:### Issue 4 (NEW) — `_consultant_feedback` sentinel undocumented
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:63:**Codex says:** "Line 167 writes feedback rows as `agent_name='_consultant_feedback'`, but the existing documented sentinels are `_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, and `_codex_ratifier`; `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` lines 16 and 257 only describe the firing agent or `_renderer` for shared helpers."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:69:Option A — **Add `_consultant_feedback` to the sentinel catalogue.** New entry in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` documenting purpose, payload shape, and emit cadence.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:71:Option B — **Use `agent_name='diagnostic'` with payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`.** Avoids creating a new sentinel; feedback is "still Diagnostic's work, just consultant-driven not agent-driven."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:73:**My recommendation:** **B** — cleaner, avoids sentinel proliferation. Feedback events are conceptually Diagnostic's domain (they validate Diagnostic outputs), so the agent_name should be Diagnostic with a specific action_type marker.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:101:- Phase 1 Diagnostic-only: **1 of 6 artefacts attempted**; result is **REJECTED-after-hard-ceiling** awaiting founder arbitration via this disagreement doc
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:118:| Diagnostic | 5 (same as Round 5 but with Issue-5-validate-impl-gap replacing Issue-5-doc-shape) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T101934Z-19923/` |
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:127:1. **Gate A vs ULTRAPLAN source-data citation strength** — every agent.md narrowed Gate A to per-section citation; ULTRAPLAN-equivalent requirements expect per-claim. Same issue, same disposition recommendation as Diagnostic Issue 1 — hybrid v0 per-section + W4 polish per-claim spot-check.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:128:2. **Workflow steps missing decision-log calls** — most agent.md files have at least one Step (notification, operator alert, status update) that produces side-effects without `hh_decision_*` call. Same disposition as Diagnostic Issue 2 — mechanical fix during W4-13 build slices when cycle.sh is implemented.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:129:3. **Kill-criterion Trigger references** — multiple agent.md files cite kill-criterion triggers that don't match the trigger definition (Janitor cites Trigger 3 correctly; Concierge cites Trigger 5 in autosend context which IS Trigger 5 territory; Diagnostic mis-cited Trigger 8). Per-agent verification needed; not a uniform pattern.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:130:4. **Sentinel agent_name usage** — _consultant_feedback (Diagnostic) is the clear case; other agents likely have similar invented sentinels. Disposition: prefer `agent_name='<agent>'` with `payload.action_type` markers; reserve sentinels for system actors (_renderer, _tenant_admin, _codex_ratifier).
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:131:5. **§5 honesty about validate.sh implementation** — agent.md §5 sections describe Gate A behaviour that may not be implemented in the corresponding `validate.sh`. For Diagnostic, validate.sh exists + has gaps (Issue 5). For the 5 new scaffolds, validate.sh DOESN'T exist yet — §5 describes intent. Disposition: explicitly mark "intended behaviour; cycle.sh + validate.sh implementation at W-X build will deliver this" in §5 of each pre-build scaffold.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:163:5. **Trigger 8 framing — DSO claim:** Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 pilots; DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's metric not Janitor's. My §5 prose conflated the two agents' Gate B narratives.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:214:1. `operator_notify_telegram` + `janitor_run_complete` are unregistered hh_decision_action types — hook-helpers fails them to red via `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`. (Found because my Round-6 commit added those calls without registering them.)
docs/runbooks/day-4-provisioning.md:1254:19. **§9 verification script bugs (Claude error, no state impact):** Initial run reported 4 FAILs of 22 checks. Diagnosis showed all were script bugs, not state failures: (a) `sshd -T` requires root to read host keys (`sudo sshd -T` works correctly); (b) `findmnt --verify` output format simpler post-LUKS-open (`Success, no errors or warnings detected`) than my regex expected. Diagnostic re-run confirmed all 22 of 22 actual state checks pass. State is verified clean.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:22:- **D1-A: Become red in v1.0** — refuse all orange action_types entirely. Concierge can't send customer-visible Bullhorn Notes at all in v1.0. Diagnostic can't send outbound emails. Cash Conductor can't send payment reminders. **Reduces Concierge to draft-only voice-classified output that the consultant manually copies.** Concierge's pitch becomes "drafts that pass voice gate" instead of "auto-send with approval gate".
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:30:**Recommended timing:** Week 9 (default; sequential with master brief §8.2). Pre-builds the bridge before Concierge W10-13 starts. Allows: Day 1-2 = bridge code + tests; Day 3 = live integration test on migration-test tenant; Day 4 (Concierge W10 start) = Concierge uses bridge from day 1. No timeline pressure on Diagnostic W3-4 or Janitor W5 (neither use orange tier action_types).
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:32:**Alternative timing:** Insert as next IFOS Claude slice now (post-Diagnostic-build, ~Week 8). Marginal benefit: D1 becomes a closed item earlier; bridge gets stress-tested before Concierge needs it. Cost: 2-3 days inserted before Concierge.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:58:**Cost of delay:** Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI. If LOI lands but advisor isn't engaged, founder has to choose between violating kill-criterion §3.4 or delaying LOI past Trigger 1. Engage now to avoid the forced choice.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:80:**Cost of delay:** Same as D2 — Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03. If LOI lands before D3 resolves, founder ships v1.0 with D3-A indefinite retention, which is the worst legal posture. Bundle D2 + D3 resolution.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:181:W3-4: Diagnostic (A1)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:192:- W4: Risk #5 (renderer) — Diagnostic first user. Reduction trigger fires (High → Medium per RISK-REGISTER #5).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:202:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Excellent.** Cash Conductor at W7-8 matches Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim. Hire #1 (assumed W7) takes Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work as first sprint — well-scoped, independent of the Bullhorn track founder has been driving solo W3-W6.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:311:- **Updates required:** same set as Trigger 1 plus founder's Q3 personal cadence (Cash Conductor's L/2-week build becomes founder solo at W7-8, slowing but not blocking).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:359:| **Diagnostic → Janitor** | **3 production-tenant runs across 3 different prospects** (per Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target context — though that target is 30% discovery-call conversion, not run count) | Renderer + `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` + decision_log all exercised end-to-end. No orchestration / inter-agent handoff (Diagnostic is standalone). `.rendered-by-ifos-renderer` marker present on all 3 rendered Diagnostic dirs |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:363:| **Sourcing Scout → Concierge** | **3 LinkedIn rate-limit-budget cycles** (each cycle = full daily rate-limit window hit and reset) **plus 1 source-discovery run** producing 5-15 candidates per Ultraplan §8.1 line 552 | LinkedIn rate-limit budget verified ≤ Day 2 §4.4 allocation; no `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` escalations sustained over a 24-hour observation window per Ultraplan §10 row #6 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:373:3. **Either fix-and-retry (1 additional week)** or **scope-cut contingency activates** per §4.3 Trigger 1 (if Risk #2 derived) or §4.3 Trigger 2 (if Risk #4 derived).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:395:### 6.2 — For Week 3 (Diagnostic build start)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:397:First agent build starts W3 per §4.1 row 1 + master brief §8.2 line 601 ("Weeks 3-4"). Concrete scope:
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:399:- Smallest viable Diagnostic exercising renderer + `_shared/` + `decision_log` end-to-end per §2.1 substrate-exercise column.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:400:- **No Bullhorn integration** for Diagnostic per master brief §8.2 line 601 ("LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape" only).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:402:- First production render lands W4 per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent at Week 4."
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:404:The W3 build / W4 first-render framing is internally consistent across master brief §8.2 ("Weeks 3-4" range), Ultraplan §9 line 753 ("Week 4: Diagnostic agent built end-to-end"), and ADR-003 design §5.2 — no discrepancy requires correction. The earlier draft concern about W3 vs W4 is resolved by the build-window-vs-completion-week distinction: Diagnostic build window is W3-W4; first production render lands W4.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:410:§4.3 Trigger 1 activation point: end of W4 weekly review if Sub-decisions A and B still Proposed.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:414:Diagnostic W3-W4 build window is the first production renderer exercise per ADR-003 design §5.2. The reduction-trigger cascade per `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risk #5 fires:
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:417:- W4 Diagnostic first-render-clean → **Medium** (renderer code proven against one production bundle).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:420:No new discrepancy to surface — earlier draft concern about W3-vs-W4 framing resolved per §6.2.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:438:- **Diagnostic doesn't render by end of W3** (Risk #5 unmitigated; renderer impl Week 1-2 didn't ship)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:450:- §5 gating criteria N values are calibrated to agent-specific risk profile (Cash Conductor's 24h sustained-operation vs Diagnostic's 3 ad-hoc runs).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:490:| Sequencing target | §4.1 | Master brief §8.2 sequence ratified verbatim: Diagnostic W3-4 → Janitor W5 → Scribe W6 → Cash Conductor W7-8 → Sourcing Scout W9 → Concierge W10-13 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:494:| W3 vs W4 framing | §6.2 + §6.4 | Build-window-vs-completion-week distinction: Diagnostic build W3-W4, first production render W4. Not a true discrepancy. |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:507:| Substrate readiness for W3 Diagnostic build (renderer + `_shared/` + `decision_log`) | Claude Code | End of W2 | Already tracked from ADR-002 + ADR-003 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:508:| Day 2 commercial conversations land by start of W4 (Risk #2 reduction triggers) | Founder | Sunday-Monday outreach; resolved by end of W3 | Already tracked from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:520:| Diagnostic W3 build start (vs W4 first render) | If renderer impl slips past end of W2, Diagnostic build start slips correspondingly |
packages/harness/cortextos/community/skills/system-diagnostics/SKILL.md:8:# System Diagnostics
docs/decisions/ADR-004-renderer-implementation-deviations.md:144:**For Risk #5 (renderer-not-built).** Severity unchanged at High per ADR-003 line 145 staged ladder ("Drops to Medium once renderer code is committed AND the Diagnostic agent renders cleanly (Week 4)"). The Phase-2 commit `3c16d35` satisfies the first condition; the second condition (Diagnostic render) is gated on Q1 design-partner LOI. ADR-004 closes a stylistic gap (3 deviations) but does not change risk severity.
docs/decisions/ADR-004-renderer-implementation-deviations.md:150:**For future Diagnostic builds.** Decision 1 means agents/runbooks/onboarding-wizard documentation references `ifos-render-agent`, not `cortextos-ifos render-agent`. Cheap to update everywhere because no documentation has shipped yet — only ADR-003 + master brief §8.3 reference the old name, and both are addressed in §"Master brief edits authorised."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:20:**Counter:** Codex is applying the Day-7 single-sentence-test Q3 quality gate ("ATS decided + auth cleared") as if it were a Week-1 implementation gate. The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:31:Specifically: per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1 line 96, Diagnostic (the first agent build, W3-4) is explicitly "no Bullhorn; Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY)." Per ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1, Diagnostic's MCP tools are "Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages" — no Bullhorn. **Diagnostic W3-4 build does not touch the Bullhorn auth path at all.**

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:61:### Trigger 2 — DIAGNOSTIC-NO-RENDER-W3 (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:63:**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:69:**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:158:### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:186:### Trigger 10 — PII-LEAKAGE-INCIDENT (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:212:- For all KILL actions: founder decides; activates within 24h (within 4h for Trigger 10 PII per §3.5 emergency authority).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:226:- **Trigger 1 (Design partner) PAUSE → KILL escalation:** if PAUSE extends 4 weeks without signed LOI, founder consults Jack on whether to escalate to KILL (commercial assessment of pipeline) or extend PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:227:- **Trigger 8 (Gate-B revenue) KILL:** founder decides KILL on revenue evidence; consults Jack on wind-down terms with existing pilots before 30-day notice goes out.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:237:### §3.5 — Emergency authority (Trigger 10 PII-LEAKAGE-INCIDENT specifically)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:239:Trigger 10 escalates regulatory-clock-driven actions. UK GDPR Art. 33 mandates ICO notification within 72 hours of discovery; multi-person consultation cannot delay this clock.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:334:- The agent fleet of 6 named in master brief §8.2 (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:371:**For Week 0 remaining.** Day 6 (vertical schema v0.1) and Day 7 (single-sentence test + Codex run) do not depend on this criterion directly. Day 7's question 1 (design partner LOI) is the structural Week-0 gate; this criterion's Trigger 1 (DESIGN-PARTNER-BY-WEEK-2) explicitly references that gap.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:373:**For Week 1-2.** All Week-1 work is conducted with awareness that Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI (per §1 calendar — Wednesday end-of-Week-2). Founder allocates time accordingly: design-partner acquisition is a Week-1 sub-track, not an afterthought.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:375:**For Week 3-13 (v1.0 build).** Every agent build references this kill criterion. Diagnostic (W3-4) faces Trigger 2; Janitor (W5) faces Trigger 3; all agents from W3 onward face Triggers 5, 6, 9. The kill criterion is the operational definition of "are we still on-track" at each weekly review.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:75:Six v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge. Each action below has a v1.0 default tier; tenant overrides can elevate (see §8).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:81:| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_report_render` | Internal artefact write; no external comms; idempotent (re-render overwrites) |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:108:| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_email_send` | Outbound diagnostic report to prospect; sales-stage outreach; reputation |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:109:| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_calendar_invite` | Books intro call with prospect; reputation + scheduling friction |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:229:Agents cannot invoke action_types not declared in their `tools.yaml`. Renderer validates this at render time per ADR-003 §4 (`ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` reason `bundle-malformed` if a declared action_type isn't in the policy).
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:235:Three new escalation codes added to `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` per master brief §8.1 Change 3. Codes follow the payload template established by `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` in `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §4.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:358:| Action_type declared in `tools.yaml` but missing from `autosend-policy.yaml` | Renderer pre-flight validation per ADR-003 §4 | `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` with `reason='bundle-malformed'`; render aborts before agent deploys | Add `action_type` to policy file; Codex ratifies; re-render |
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:634:**For Week 3-4 (Diagnostic agent build).** Diagnostic's `tools.yaml` will declare 3 action_types: `diagnostic_report_render` (green), `diagnostic_email_send` (orange — falls back to ad-hoc Telegram approval at v1.0 per §9 + §11 question 6), `diagnostic_calendar_invite` (orange — same).

codex
The local artefact is the production-shape Diagnostic file, not just the embedded text. I’ve found a few likely verification points now: action tiers live in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`, kill triggers in `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md`, and the ESC catalogue has the cited codes. Next I’m checking whether the strongest claims match those files exactly.

   260	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   261	
   262	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (skill built Day 19; commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md plus the 5 sibling bundle files plus 3 fixtures ratify as a unit at W3 build end.
   263	
   264	Status flips to Accepted when:
   265	- Codex Round-3+ ratifies the full bundle
   266	- Founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical
   267	- First production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   268	- Gate B baseline measurement begins (30% target; 4-week window)
   269	
   270	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

    73	## §3 — Examples per tier across the v1.0 agent surface
    74	
    75	Six v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge. Each action below has a v1.0 default tier; tenant overrides can elevate (see §8).
    76	
    77	### Green examples (auto-send without review)
    78	
    79	| Agent | action_type | Why green |
    80	|---|---|---|
    81	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_report_render` | Internal artefact write; no external comms; idempotent (re-render overwrites) |
    82	| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_tag` | Adds a tag with `checked_at` date; reversible in <30s; high volume |
    83	| Scribe | `bullhorn_note_internal` | Writes to internal-only Bullhorn note section (`isExternal: false`); visible only to consultant; non-customer-facing |
    84	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_profile_cache` | Stores profile snapshot to `/vault/<tenant>/wiki/raw/`; no external send; no rate-limit cost |
    85	| Cash Conductor | `xero_query_invoices` | Read-only against Xero; rate-limited via Xero's own quotas; no side effect |
    86	| Concierge | `bullhorn_brief_read` | Read of inbound brief; idempotent; no comms |
    87	
    88	### Yellow examples (auto-send with spot-check sampling)
    89	
    90	| Agent | action_type | Sample rate | Why yellow |
    91	|---|---|---|---|
    92	| Janitor | `bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` | 1-in-10 | Merges duplicate candidate records; reversible but high-volume; merge quality needs ongoing review |
    93	| Scribe | `bullhorn_note_append_summary` | 1-in-20 | Appends to candidate record; visible to consultant only; high-volume; format quality needs review |
    94	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_connection_request` | 1-in-5 | Outbound LinkedIn action subject to rate limits + reputation effects; sample for tone + targeting accuracy |
    95	| Cash Conductor | `xero_reminder_draft_internal` | 1-in-10 | Generates reminder draft visible to consultant; not yet sent; format + tone needs review |
    96	| Concierge | `bullhorn_note_draft_internal` | 1-in-10 | Drafts a Bullhorn Note for consultant review (not yet sent); high-volume; voice drift candidate |
    97	
    98	### Orange examples (per-action human approval)
    99	
   100	| Agent | action_type | Why orange |
   101	|---|---|---|
   102	| **Concierge** | **`bullhorn_note_customer_visible`** | **CANONICAL ORANGE.** Writes a Bullhorn Note with `isExternal: true` (or equivalent) that becomes visible to the customer's full team in their CRM. Single send is irreversible (note remains in audit trail even if deleted). Source: `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 (establishes Concierge produces Notes on every lifecycle-event communication) + §6.3 (explicit sensitivity framing: "Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI"). |
   103	| Concierge | `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` | Outbound email to candidate; customer-facing; reputation effects |
   104	| Concierge | `twilio_sms_send` | Outbound SMS; high-trust channel; cost-per-send; irreversible |
   105	| Concierge | `calendar_invite_send` | Creates calendar event with attendee notification; visible to attendee |
   106	| Scribe | `email_summary_to_customer` | Outbound email summarising call to customer; customer-facing; format-sensitive |
   107	| Cash Conductor | `xero_reminder_send_customer` | Outbound payment reminder to customer; reputation + collection risk |
   108	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_email_send` | Outbound diagnostic report to prospect; sales-stage outreach; reputation |
   109	| Diagnostic | `diagnostic_calendar_invite` | Books intro call with prospect; reputation + scheduling friction |
   110	| Sourcing Scout | `linkedin_inmail_send` | Outbound InMail (paid credit); cost-per-send; customer-facing |
   111	| Janitor | `bullhorn_placement_terminate` | Marks placement as terminated; commercial/legal implications; reversible only via support ticket |

   485	### 8.1 v1.0 agents (six)
   486	
   487	#### A1. The Diagnostic — the sales tool
   488	
   489	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 4–5)
   490	- **Always-on?** No — invoked on demand
   491	- **Trigger type:** Manual (run from CLI or sales-tool web page)
   492	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None — runs as a one-shot batch job
   493	- **MCP tools required:** Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages
   494	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (uses Maddox's voice for the audit narrative), decision log writer
   495	- **External APIs:** Companies House API (free), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), basic HTTP fetch
   496	- **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data
   497	- **Gate B target:** ≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked
   498	- **Build complexity:** **M** (1 week)
   499	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn ToS — we cannot store profile data beyond the audit. Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.
   500	
   501	#### A2. The Janitor — the wedge agent
   502	
   503	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 5–6)
   504	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — scheduled nightly cron
   505	- **Trigger type:** Cron 02:00 UTC daily; manual full-cleanup on demand

   561	
   562	**The bundle at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` is the source artefact; the cortextOS daemon does not read it directly.** The renderer (`packages/agent-renderer/`, per `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` and `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) translates the bundle into a cortextOS-shaped per-agent directory at `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` per-tenant. Source bundle authored once; rendered N times (once per active tenant). The `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command is **NOT** the IFOS path — it inherits 24 cortextOS template skills the IFOS bundle does not want.
   563	
   564	### 8.1 The three v2 changes (Ultraplan §4.2)
   565	
   566	**Change 1 — Voice handling moves into `_shared/voice-loader.sh`.** No agent reads the voice corpus directly. Every `context.sh` calls `hh_load_tone_rules`, `hh_load_voice_samples`, `hh_load_recent_edits`. Agent context scripts become 30 lines, not 200.
   567	
   568	**Change 2 — Decision logging is enforced.** Three required calls per agent run:
   569	
   570	```bash
   571	hh_decision_trigger   # at start; logs trigger
   572	hh_decision_output    # on output; logs the artefact
   573	hh_decision_action    # when human acts; logs the action
   574	```
   575	
   576	`validate.sh` hard-fails on missing calls. This is what enables the v2.0 LoRA pipeline — no decision log, no SFT corpus, no Scale-tier moat.
   577	
   578	**Change 3 — Escalation codes expand to recruitment vocabulary.** ~20–30 codes. Examples:
   579	
   580	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` — voice classifier score below threshold after retries
   581	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — OAuth token expired/revoked
   582	- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — high-confidence dedup needs human review
   583	- `ESC_JSL_RED_FLAG` — Supply Chain Auditor detected red flag
   584	- `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   585	- `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` — output references PII outside firm boundary
   586	- `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` — upstream API rate-limited (esp. LinkedIn)
   587	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — agent produced output violating vertical schema
   588	
   589	Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.
   590	
   591	### 8.2 The build order — v1.0 only
   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).
   605	
   606	### 8.3 The working pattern in Claude Code
   607	
   608	For any new agent:
   609	
   610	```bash
   611	git checkout -b agent/{name}                       # e.g. agent/janitor
   612	mkdir -p agents/recruitment/{name}/tests/fixtures/{01-primary,02-edge-case-{X},99-voice-drift-canary}
   613	
   614	# In Claude Code, work the bundle through 6 files in this order:
   615	# 1. README.md (2-min overview)

 succeeded in 0ms:
    45	### Trigger 1 — DESIGN-PARTNER-BY-WEEK-2 (PAUSE)
    46	
    47	**Threshold:** No design partner has confirmed pilot intent (signed LOI or equivalent written commitment to pilot in Q3 2026 per master brief §6 Day 7 question 1) by end of Week 2.
    48	
    49	**Calendar:** Day 0 was 2026-05-13 (Wednesday). Week 0 runs Days 0-7, ending Wednesday 2026-05-20. Week 1 starts Thursday 2026-05-21. Week 2 ends Wednesday 2026-06-03. **Trigger fires end-of-day 2026-06-03 if criterion unmet.**
    50	
    51	**Owner:** Founder; daily check during Weeks 1-2.
    52	
    53	**Source:** Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (escalating status); Day-5 Risk #3 update reflects "zero design partners in pipeline" as of this commit; master brief §6 Day 7 question 1.
    54	
    55	**Action:** PAUSE state activated immediately. Agent code halts at end of current week's slice (rather than mid-slice). Founder pivots to full-time design-partner acquisition. Claude Code work limited to design-partner-supporting artefacts (sales decks, demo agents, pricing models).
    56	
    57	**Unfreeze criterion:** **One signed pilot LOI** from a UK recruitment agency with stated pilot start date in Q3 2026. Unfreeze formal: Founder + Jack joint sign-off on the LOI; resume v1.0 from the slice that was active when paused.
    58	
    59	**Escalation path if PAUSE extends:** if unfreeze not achieved within 4 weeks of PAUSE activation, strategic review reconvenes. Outcomes: (a) continue PAUSE if pipeline is materially active; (b) escalate to KILL if no pipeline activity; (c) escalate to PIVOT if pipeline rejection signals point to a different vertical/ATS.
    60	
    61	### Trigger 2 — DIAGNOSTIC-NO-RENDER-W3 (KILL)
    62	
    63	**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
    64	
    65	**Owner:** Claude Code (technical detection); founder review (decision authority). Weekly check during Weeks 1-3.
    66	
    67	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (i); Risk #5 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; ADR-003 §"Consequences" line 141 (renderer is load-bearing Week-1 deliverable).
    68	
    69	**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
    70	
    71	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons logged to `.agents/learnings/v1.0-postmortem.md`. v1.1 may begin as new initiative with reconsidered renderer architecture (or no per-tenant render, or different bundle pattern).
    72	
    73	### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
    74	
    75	**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
   158	### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
   159	
   160	**Threshold:** After 3 completed pilots (defined as: pilot ran for ≥90 days with active agent fleet and quarterly Gate B revenue measurement), average Gate B revenue uplift per tenant <£20k/year.
   161	
   162	**Owner:** Founder; assessed at end of each pilot.
   163	
   164	**Source:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 — canonical example trigger from master brief.
   165	
   166	**Action:** KILL. Rationale: the wedge does not produce demonstrable ROI at the threshold required to sustain v1.0 commercially. £20k/year/tenant is the breakeven floor — below this, IFOS cannot fund continued operation at v1.0 pricing.
   167	
   168	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons feed v1.1 if launched. The vertical assumption (UK recruitment) or product assumption (agent fleet vs. point tools) may need reconsidering for any next initiative.
   169	
   170	### Trigger 9 — CORTEXOS-PRIMITIVE-CHRONIC-FAILURE (PAUSE)
   171	
   172	**Threshold:** cortextOS primitives 3 (file bus per `cortexos-primitive-status.md` line item 3) or 4 (approval gates per primitive 4) report >1 production incident per week across **2 consecutive weeks** for any single pilot.
   173	
   174	**Threshold tightened Day 5 (2026-05-18) from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.** Rationale: Risk #1 severity was downgraded Day 1 because primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" per `cortexos-primitive-status.md`. If field evidence shows failure-rate spike for 2 consecutive weeks, that is an actionable signal — waiting 4 weeks delays remediation by 50% within the v1.0 build timeline (Weeks 1-13).
   175	
   176	**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
   177	
   178	**Source:** Master brief §12 Risk #1; Day-1 audit results in `cortexos-primitive-status.md` (primitive 1 PTY/PM2 is "shipped but flaky"; primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" but field evidence may diverge).

    80	Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
    81	
    82	Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
    83	
    84	**Section 4's recommendation evaluates both orderings** (founder-prompt-Alpha and master-brief-Alpha) against the §1.3 criteria, picks whichever wins on the merits, and explicitly aligns with the master brief by default unless rationale exists to revise it. This document is the "confirm or revise" decision per master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 — both options are on the table.

    88	## Section 2 — Per-agent readiness assessment
    89	
    90	Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.
    91	
    92	### 2.1 — A1 Diagnostic
    93	
    94	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
    95	|---|---|---|
    96	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
    97	| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
    98	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
    99	| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Internal sales tool per Product Spec §2.2 R13 ("Not on the customer pricing card"). Drives qualified discovery-call pipeline. Demoable to a prospect but not the closing demo. Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target: "≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked" |
   100	| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **None** | Standalone. No upstream agent dependency; no downstream agent consumes Diagnostic output |
   101	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **High** | Runnable from end of Week 2 with renderer + `_shared/` + Postgres decision_log. No vault `_secrets.env` complexity (no per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth needed), no wiki API needed. Single-tenant deployable immediately |
   102	
   103	**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
   104	
   105	### 2.2 — A2 Janitor
   106	
   107	| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
   108	|---|---|---|
   109	| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 513 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — the Bullhorn MCP work is rate-limiting per Ultraplan §8.1 line 514 ("Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build"). One MCP server (Bullhorn) + Companies House for enrichment. Single primary output (cleanup report) but with continuous nightly cron pattern |
   110	| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
   111	| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
   112	| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
   113	| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
   114	| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:158:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:169:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:191:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:69:Option A — **Add `_consultant_feedback` to the sentinel catalogue.** New entry in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` documenting purpose, payload shape, and emit cadence.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:130:4. **Sentinel agent_name usage** — _consultant_feedback (Diagnostic) is the clear case; other agents likely have similar invented sentinels.

agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:158:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:162:- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3) — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if voice-classifier URL unreachable; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:165:- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if firm-domain whitelist absent; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:169:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.

1. Optional Telegram notification bypasses Gate B decision logging. `agent.md` lines 140-143 require `hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", ...)`, but `cycle.sh` lines 193-200 sends the Telegram message directly with `curl` and emits no `hh_decision_*` row. Fix `cycle.sh` to call `hh_decision_action operator_notify_telegram` before sending, or remove the notification surface.

2.

Fix either the implementation or the prose.

3. Gate A escalation mapping contradicts the catalogue and the artefact. `agent.md` line 185 maps output-shape failures to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`, and line 165 maps PII hits to `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK`; `validate.sh` lines 233-239 emits `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` through action type `validate_gate_a_fail`. Fix `validate.sh` to emit the specific ESC codes declared in §6 and register/use a valid autosend action type.

4. §3 does not meet the required Output shape contract. `agent.md` lines 43-60 enumerate the 12 report sections, but the type-specific skill requires §3 to name artefact paths and the `decision_log` audit-row signature for each output. Fix §3 to include the vault path plus expected `phase`, `agent_name`, `output_type`/`action_type`, and payload keys.

5. §8 gives inaccurate build status. `agent.md` line 226 says `validate.sh` Gate A logic is “Not built”, while line 158 discusses the current v0 `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implementation and the file exists. Fix the dependency table to distinguish built-but-incomplete checks from genuinely missing prerequisites.
