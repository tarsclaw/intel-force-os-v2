=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Janitor — the wedge agent

**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Cron (v1.0)

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)

```bash
ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
```

`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.

### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: candidate `bullhorn_id` per vertical-schema.yaml candidate entity, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | TWO independent thresholds per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. Both must pass. NOT a composite score — that would let one threshold cover for the other. |
| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |

### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)

Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):

1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 124), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

---

## §4 — Workflow

12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")

1. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)

3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)

4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)

5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 124),
     client.industry (line 238), client.size_employees (line 243),
     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   → identify missing-field rows
   → batch enrichment calls
   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")

6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429

7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
     signup commercial decision)
   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
     current_company → write back

8. Tacit-note harvest
   → query the `recent_edit` v0.2 table directly (per vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml
     §1.3): SELECT FROM recent_edit WHERE resolved_at > now() - interval '30 days'
     AND resolution='approved_after_edit' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → join to decision_log only if action-context lookups needed
   → group by target_entity_type (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)

9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff

10. Day-30 report assembly
   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")

11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")

12. Session close
   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → exit code 0 (or 1 if Gate-B missed for 3 consecutive runs → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)

Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint; per Day-19 catalogue add at `escalation-codes.md` line 184) OR `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (merge-confidence reject; existing line 127) per the failed condition. Draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — that code is reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.

Two independent thresholds (both must pass): dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. NOT a composite — composite would let one cover the other.

Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.

Failing either threshold for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

All codes are registered in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (catalogue extended to 52 codes per `2026-05-24` bilateral disposition; see disagreement-doc + `catalogue(bilateral)` commit).

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` | Per catalogue trigger: dedup confidence ≥0.85 cases requiring human review (NOT used for <0.85 reject cases — those silently drop per Step 3 algorithm) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Either independent Gate-B threshold (dedup <15% OR field-completeness <10%) missed for 3 consecutive runs. NOT a composite — see §5 Gate B for the two-threshold rule. | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Janitor does NOT use:

- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)

Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)

1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-24.
     5	**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
     6	**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
     7	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
     8	**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

    12	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    13	
    14	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    15	
    16	> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

    20	## §2 — Invocation surface
    21	
    22	### Cron (v1.0)
    23	
    24	```bash
    25	# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
    26	0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
    27	```
    28	
    29	Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.
    30	
    31	### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)
    32	
    33	```bash
    34	ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
    35	```
    36	
    37	`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).
    38	
    39	### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)
    40	
    41	- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
    42	- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)
    43	
    44	---
    45	
    46	## §3 — Output shape
    47	
    48	Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.
    49	
    50	### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report
    51	
    52	Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:
    53	
    54	| # | Section | Content |
    55	|---|---|---|
    56	| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
    57	| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: candidate `bullhorn_id` per vertical-schema.yaml candidate entity, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
    58	| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
    59	| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
    60	| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
    61	| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | TWO independent thresholds per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. Both must pass. NOT a composite score — that would let one threshold cover for the other. |
    62	| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
    63	| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |
    64	
    65	### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)
    66	
    67	Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):
    68	
    69	1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    70	2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` (line 124), `client.industry` (line 238), `client.size_employees` (line 243), `client.companies_house_number` (line 252), `contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max` (lines 193-197), `brief.salary_min/salary_max` (lines 371-376) from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    71	3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_note_attach`** (registered in autosend-policy.yaml; yellow tier; sample_rate: 20).
    72	
    73	Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.
    74

    76	
    77	## §4 — Workflow
    78	
    79	12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
    80	
    81	```
    82	0. Session start
    83	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
    84	     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
    85	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")
    86	
    87	1. Bullhorn auth refresh
    88	   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
    89	     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
    90	   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries
    91	
    92	2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
    93	   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
    94	     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
    95	     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
    96	   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
    97	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)
    98	
    99	3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   100	   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   101	   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   102	   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   103	   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
   104	     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   105	   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
   106	     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)
   107	
   108	4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   109	   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
   110	     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)
   111	
   112	5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   113	   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 124),
   114	     client.industry (line 238), client.size_employees (line 243),
   115	     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
   116	     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   117	   → identify missing-field rows
   118	   → batch enrichment calls
   119	   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")
   120	
   121	6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   122	   → companies_house.search(client.name per vertical-schema.yaml line 235) → CRN →
   123	     profile → fill canonical schema fields client.industry (line 238),
   124	     client.companies_house_number (line 252)
   125	   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   126	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429
   127	
   128	7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   129	   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
   130	     signup commercial decision)
   131	   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
   132	     current_company → write back
   133	
   134	8. Tacit-note harvest
   135	   → query the `recent_edit` v0.2 table directly (per vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml
   136	     §1.3): SELECT FROM recent_edit WHERE resolved_at > now() - interval '30 days'
   137	     AND resolution='approved_after_edit' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   138	   → join to decision_log only if action-context lookups needed
   139	   → group by target_entity_type (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   140	   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
   141	     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)
   142	
   143	9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   144	   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
   145	     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row

   173	## §5 — Gates
   174	
   175	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   176	
   177	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:
   178	
   179	- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
   180	- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
   181	- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   182	- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
   183	- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
   184	- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
   185	- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)
   186	
   187	Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint; per Day-19 catalogue add at `escalation-codes.md` line 184) OR `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (merge-confidence reject; existing line 127) per the failed condition. Draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required. `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) is NOT used by Janitor — that code is reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time.
   188	
   189	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   190	
   191	Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.
   192	
   193	Two independent thresholds (both must pass): dedup improvement ≥15% AND field-completeness improvement ≥10%. NOT a composite — composite would let one cover the other.
   194	
   195	Gate B doesn't block the agent. The day-30 dedup + field-completeness improvement is Janitor's local Gate B metric per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim. It contributes evidence (alongside other agents' Gate-B metrics) to kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 (average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166) — but Janitor does NOT directly claim Trigger 8 status. DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's territory per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540, not Janitor's.
   196	
   197	Failing either threshold for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).
   198	
   199	---
   200	
   201	## §6 — Escalation codes
   202	
   203	All codes are registered in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (catalogue extended to 52 codes per `2026-05-24` bilateral disposition; see disagreement-doc + `catalogue(bilateral)` commit).
   204	
   205	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   206	|---|---|---|---|
   207	| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   208	| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
   209	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
   210	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   211	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   212	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   213	| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` | Per catalogue trigger: dedup confidence ≥0.85 cases requiring human review (NOT used for <0.85 reject cases — those silently drop per Step 3 algorithm) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   214	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Either independent Gate-B threshold (dedup <15% OR field-completeness <10%) missed for 3 consecutive runs. NOT a composite — see §5 Gate B for the two-threshold rule. | warn | operator_chat_id |
   215	| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |
   216	
   217	Janitor does NOT use:
   218	
   219	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
   220	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
   221	- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
   222	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
   223	
   224	---
   225	
   226	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   227	
   228	Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   229	
   230	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
   231	  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
   232	  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
   233	  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
   234	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
   235	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.
   236	
   237	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.
   238

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:8:**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:16:> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:29:Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

Obsidian users typically git-init their vaults. **Recommendation:** yes — initialize `/vault/{tenant}/.git/` at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder gets free history, blame, and rollback via Obsidian Git plugin. Agents do NOT commit; the founder commits manually or via a scheduled cron run by Janitor's nightly sweep. **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — git init is one line in `provision-tenant.sh`; commit cadence can be decided in Week 1.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:155:## Janitor Round-5 (remediation) — empirical confirmation of bilateral pattern
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:157:After all 6 Round-4-v2 issues remediated on Janitor (commit `2392af8`), Round-5 ratification returned REJECTED with **5 NEW findings** — none of the original 6 reappeared. New issues at Janitor session `20260524T103757Z-37420`:
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:160:2. **`bullhorn_field_backfill` unregistered, would fail-safe to red:** my flag-for-addition framing didn't satisfy because `hook-helpers.sh::autosend_policy_lookup` fails to red on unknown action types AT RUNTIME, regardless of flag prose. Real bug requires either (a) policy row added BEFORE ratification, OR (b) explicit "blocked W5 prerequisite" framing not "executable output."
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:161:3. **§5 vs §6 ESC code contradiction:** §5 prose retains `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` reference even though §6 explicitly says Janitor doesn't use it. Mechanical fix missed by my Round-4-v2 remediation.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md:163:5. **Trigger 8 framing — DSO claim:** Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 pilots; DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's metric not Janitor's. My §5 prose conflated the two agents' Gate B narratives.

docs/decisions/ADR-005-week-3-diagnostic-acceleration.md:78:**Net effect of worst case (Bullhorn never responds + Direct-API forced):** Janitor + Scribe + Sourcing Scout + Concierge all slip ~1 week each; Cash Conductor (W7-8) unaffected; v1.0 ships in W14 instead of W13. Master brief §8.2 line 604 acknowledges this contingency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:22:| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:34:- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:44:**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:114:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:126:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:127:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:129:**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library. Source-abstraction layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 designed to be reusable by Night Sourcer v1.1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:155:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn (already on if Janitor shipped) + LinkedIn (Proxycurl API key — single application-level key, not per-tenant) + Reed OAuth + CV-Library OAuth per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:182:W5:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:209:W9:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:282:| 2 | W5 | **Janitor** (A2) | First Bullhorn auth + downstream-pattern-setter (Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge inherit) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:408:First exercise is Janitor at W5 per §4.1 row 2. **If Day 2 Sub-decisions A and B haven't flipped from Proposed to Accepted by start of W4** (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 commercial-blocker table), this is the natural blocker. Founder Sunday/Monday commercial conversations must land before W4 start to keep the Janitor W5 slot intact. Sub-decision C is already Accepted so the endpoint surface is buildable; the gate is auth path (A) and client_credentials foreclosure (B).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:439:- **Janitor's first Bullhorn auth refresh fails by W5** (Risk #2 unmitigated; commercial path broken)

Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.

So Bullhorn integration timing gates ~67% of the v1.0 agent build. Per Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency wording: "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1" — that is the documented v1.0-scope cut if Bullhorn slips.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:62:- **What ATS the first design partner uses.** If the first signed pilot is on Vincere or Voyager Infinity instead of Bullhorn, Sub-decision C's endpoint surface (and the Janitor / Concierge build order) needs revisiting per master brief §6 Day 2 Sub-decision and Ultraplan §9.1 sequencing.

A+B MUST flip to Accepted before Janitor (W5) build starts per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5). A+B are NOT a Week-1 prereq gate; they ARE a W5 agent-build gate.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:184:2. **Direct API access is technically sufficient for v1.0.** The public REST API documentation surveyed (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) names no entity-level scope gating for marketplace-tier vs direct-tier. The endpoint surface required by the four Bullhorn-touching v1.0 agents (Janitor R+W, Scribe W, Sourcing Scout R, Concierge R+W per §1.2) is fully addressable via documented direct-API REST endpoints — barring a commercially-gated discovery in §1.3 conversation that contradicts this.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:20:**Counter:** Codex is applying the Day-7 single-sentence-test Q3 quality gate ("ATS decided + auth cleared") as if it were a Week-1 implementation gate. The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:73:### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:75:**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:85:- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:158:### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:227:- **Trigger 8 (Gate-B revenue) KILL:** founder decides KILL on revenue evidence; consults Jack on wind-down terms with existing pilots before 30-day notice goes out.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:334:- The agent fleet of 6 named in master brief §8.2 (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:375:**For Week 3-13 (v1.0 build).** Every agent build references this kill criterion. Diagnostic (W3-4) faces Trigger 2; Janitor (W5) faces Trigger 3; all agents from W3 onward face Triggers 5, 6, 9. The kill criterion is the operational definition of "are we still on-track" at each weekly review.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:75:Six v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge. Each action below has a v1.0 default tier; tenant overrides can elevate (see §8).

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:636:**For Week 5-13 (Janitor → Concierge).** Each agent's `tools.yaml` declares its action_types. The renderer per ADR-003 §4 validates declarations against this policy. Bullhorn-integration-path §4.1 + §6.3's Concierge Note auto-send sensitivity ("notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI") is materially mitigated: the canonical orange example in §3 ensures every Concierge Note write goes through approval at v1.0 (ad-hoc) and v1.1+ (policy-driven).

The first pass found several likely drift points: the artefact alternates between `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` and `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`, and the shared policy has the Janitor Bullhorn actions but not necessarily with the claimed tier. I’m checking the exact rows before deciding the verdict.

    70	
    71	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons logged to `.agents/learnings/v1.0-postmortem.md`. v1.1 may begin as new initiative with reconsidered renderer architecture (or no per-tenant render, or different bundle pattern).
    72	
    73	### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
    74	
    75	**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
    76	
    77	**Owner:** Founder + Claude Code. Weekly check during Weeks 3-5.
    78	
    79	**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (ii); Risk #2 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md`; `bullhorn-integration-path.md` Sub-decisions A + B (currently Proposed pending Sunday/Monday commercial conversations — which themselves have not happened due to design-partner-pipeline gap).
    80	
    81	**Action:** PIVOT state. Rescope from Bullhorn-first to alternate ATS-first:
    82	
    83	- **Option A:** Vincere-first. Mid-market UK recruitment ATS; smaller market than Bullhorn but more accessible API.
    84	- **Option B:** Voyager Infinity-first. UK-native ATS; smaller market; alternative auth model.
    85	- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
   155	
   156	**Recovery path:** Rescoped infrastructure plan; pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (master brief does not specify a numeric cost target; budget adjustment is a runbook revision, not a master-brief edit).
   157	
   158	### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
   159	
   160	**Threshold:** After 3 completed pilots (defined as: pilot ran for ≥90 days with active agent fleet and quarterly Gate B revenue measurement), average Gate B revenue uplift per tenant <£20k/year.
   161	
   162	**Owner:** Founder; assessed at end of each pilot.
   163	
   164	**Source:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 — canonical example trigger from master brief.
   165	
   166	**Action:** KILL. Rationale: the wedge does not produce demonstrable ROI at the threshold required to sustain v1.0 commercially. £20k/year/tenant is the breakeven floor — below this, IFOS cannot fund continued operation at v1.0 pricing.
   167	
   168	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons feed v1.1 if launched. The vertical assumption (UK recruitment) or product assumption (agent fleet vs. point tools) may need reconsidering for any next initiative.

    98	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent enters degraded mode (drafts-only, no auto-send)
    99	- **Trigger:** Bullhorn OAuth token refresh failed twice on the per-agent 8-minute cycle (per `common-ats.json.auth_refresh_interval_seconds`); or REST call returned 401 indefinitely (revoked token in Bullhorn admin UI)

   341	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING`
   342	- **Severity:** info — distinct from ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW (which is the initial queue event)
   343	- **Trigger:** Orange-tier action has been pending operator response for ≥50% of declared `timeout` (heartbeat reminder before bridge timeout)
   344	- **Phase:** `action`

   357	- **Severity:** warn — concurrency / state-change race
   358	- **Trigger:** A send is about to fire when the underlying state has changed in a way that should suppress it. Two canonical use cases:
   359	  - **Duplicate-payload race:** two agents attempted to send the same `payload_hash` within same tenant within `race_window_seconds` (default 60s); second attempt detected by `decision_log` UPSERT-conflict; second wins-suppressed (first sends; idempotency by payload_hash)
   360	  - **State-change race (Cash Conductor):** payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window; the invoice is no longer overdue when the orange-tier approval fires; chase cancelled (do NOT send) per Cash Conductor §4 Step 12
   361	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   362	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   363	- **Payload fields:** `race_class` (`duplicate_payload` | `state_change_cancellation`), `payload_hash`, class-specific: duplicate → `first_agent_name`, `second_agent_name`, `time_delta_ms`, `action_type`; state-change → `entity_id`, `state_before`, `state_after`, `time_delta_ms`
   364	- **Recovery:** duplicate → second suppressed; state-change → cancelled draft logged; no operator action required beyond informational review
   365	
   366	#### `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK`
   367	- **Severity:** info — quality sampling, not a failure
   368	- **Trigger:** Yellow-tier action was sampled per `sample_rate` (1-in-N) for post-hoc human review; sampling is informational + drives ongoing quality monitoring
   369	- **Phase:** `action`
   370	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`; sampled action is queued in `spot_check_queue_path` (`/vault/{tenant_slug}/spot-checks/`)
   371	- **Payload fields:** `action_type`, `original_decision_log_id`, `sample_rate`, `sampling_reason`, `target`, `payload_preview`
   372	- **Note:** Operator review of sampled rows is asynchronous (typically end-of-day batch); no SLA timer.

   378	- **Severity:** warn — post-send quality signal; not a hard failure
   379	- **Trigger:** Agent's local Gate B metric thresholds missed for the per-agent window (e.g. Janitor dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%; Diagnostic <30% discovery-call conversion rate; etc — see each agent.md §5)

   382	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `metric_name`, `actual_value`, `threshold`, `window`, `sample_size`
   383	- **Note:** Local Gate B is a leading metric for agent quality; consecutive misses inform per-agent quality review. Not tied to a kill-criterion trigger in v1.0 (per disagreement-doc Cat-3 disposition).

Single send is irreversible (note remains in audit trail even if deleted). Source: `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 (establishes Concierge produces Notes on every lifecycle-event communication) + §6.3 (explicit sensitivity framing: "Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI"). |
   103	| Concierge | `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` | Outbound email to candidate; customer-facing; reputation effects |

     1	# Operational hygiene protocol — A-grade discipline rules
     2	
     3	**Status:** In force (Day 6, 2026-05-18). All sections from Week 0 onwards reference this document at section-gate moments.
     4	**Author:** Claude Code + founder (Maddox), Day-6 evening 2026-05-18
     5	**Source:** Lessons from Days 0-6 execution. Bumps three operational-grade dimensions from B+/C+/B → A by codifying what was previously implicit.
     6	**Audience:** This session and every future session. Reference at the start of any work that involves credentials, runbooks, drafts, or citations.
     7	
     8	---
     9	
    10	## §1 — Why this document exists
    11	
    12	Days 0-6 self-grade on Week-0 retrospective (Day-6 evening):
    13	
    14	| Dimension | Day-6 grade | A-grade target |
    15	|---|---|---|
    16	| Architectural rigour | A | maintain |
    17	| Honest signal | A | maintain |
    18	| Process discipline | A− | maintain |
    19	| **Operational hygiene** | **B+** | A |
    20	| **Length discipline** | **C+** | A |
    21	| **Citation accuracy** | **B** | A |
    22	
    23	The B+/C+/B grades reflect specific lapses where the discipline was implicit rather than written down:
    24	
    25	- **Operational hygiene B+** — Path B was allowed mid-Day-4 (LUKS passphrase entered chat); Day 4 execution had self-inflicted deviations (defensive `sudo file -s` check; missing `sudo` on `sshd -T`; outdated `findmnt` regex)
    26	- **Length discipline C+** — Day 5 autosend policy 658 lines vs 300-500 estimate; Day 6 vertical schema 899 lines vs same estimate
    27	- **Citation accuracy B** — Day 5 §4.1 should have been §4.1 + §6.3 (caught in review); Day 6 "30+" action_type claim was actually 29 (caught in review); **15 fabricated "master brief §10.4" references propagated across 5 files** (caught in Day-6-evening citation audit; see §7 below)
    28	
    29	This document codifies the rules to bring all three to A. Reference it at the section-gate moment of any future work that touches the relevant surface.
    30	
    31	---
    32	
    33	## §2 — Credential-bearing operations: Path A / Path D protocols
    34	
    35	Three named protocols for handling credentials in IFOS operations. Path A is the default for entering existing credentials; Path D is the default for generating new credentials. **Path B is forbidden absent explicit per-session founder waiver.**
    36	
    37	### §2.1 — Path A (default for credential entry)
    38	
    39	**Definition:** Founder enters credentials in their own local terminal session. Credentials never appear in Claude Code chat context, tool input, tool output, or anywhere a transcript could capture them.
    40	
    41	**Use cases:**
    42	- LUKS passphrase entry at `cryptsetup luksFormat` / `luksOpen` / `luksChangeKey`
    43	- Postgres role passwords typed into `psql` prompts
    44	- API tokens entered into Console UIs
    45	- Any password prompt that the application requests interactively
    46	
    47	**Mechanism:**
    48	1. Claude Code prepares the command and surfaces it to the founder
    49	2. Founder opens a fresh local terminal (or uses an existing one outside Claude Code's tool scope)
    50	3. Founder runs the command interactively
    51	4. Founder reports back: success / failure + relevant non-credential output
    52	
    53	**Trade-off:** ~30-90 seconds of founder time per interactive step vs. zero credential exposure.
    54	
    55	**Day-4 lesson:** Path A was the initial agreed protocol for §4.2 luksFormat + §4.3 luksOpen + §4.8 ifos-unlock end-to-end test. Path B was authorised mid-Day-4 for the ifos-unlock test specifically; the operational friction of Path A was found acceptable for first-use (luksFormat) but unacceptable for repeated use (ifos-unlock). Mitigation: Path D pattern (§2.3) eliminates many would-be-Path-B cases by generating credentials on-VPS where they never need to be re-entered.
    56	
    57	### §2.2 — Path B (FORBIDDEN absent explicit waiver)
    58	
    59	**Definition:** Credential enters Claude Code chat context, then gets piped via stdin or written to a temporary file for command execution.
    60	
    61	**Why forbidden:**
    62	- Chat transcript captures the credential
    63	- Future transcript export, search history, or harness telemetry retains it
    64	- Cannot be scrubbed retroactively
    65	- Required to rotate the credential post-use to invalidate the transcript-captured copy
    66	
    67	**Waiver process if Path B is genuinely needed:**
    68	1. Founder types literally: `Path B: protocol override authorised` followed by the credential on a new line
    69	2. Claude Code uses the credential once, immediately
    70	3. Founder **MUST rotate the credential within 24 hours** — non-negotiable. `cryptsetup luksChangeKey` for LUKS; equivalent rotation API for Postgres/OAuth/etc.
    71	4. Rotation **MUST be verified** — for LUKS, `cryptsetup luksChangeKey --test-passphrase` confirms OLD rejected + NEW accepted; for Postgres, `psql -c "SELECT 1;"` with OLD credentials fails and with NEW succeeds
    72	5. Rotation logged in `.agents/decisions/<date>-path-b-rotation-<n>.md` with the original need, the rotation evidence, AND the cryptographic verification output
    73	
    74	**Codex Round 1 strengthening (2026-05-20):** the waiver text above is the *escape hatch*, not the default. **Any Path B use without same-session rotation is a protocol violation that counts as a Risk #1 strike** (operational hygiene degraded). Founder may invoke Path B exactly once per emergency context (e.g., boot-time `ifos-unlock` when Path A is impossible because no interactive terminal is available). Repeated Path B use in a single session indicates Path A/Path D pattern is insufficient — escalate to a new ADR rather than authorise repeatedly.
    75	
    76	**Day-4 incident (reference example of a correctly-handled Path B use):** Path B was authorised once for §4.8 ifos-unlock end-to-end test. Founder rotated WITHIN THE SAME SESSION via `cryptsetup luksChangeKey`; `--test-passphrase` verified OLD rejected + NEW accepted. The leaked passphrase in the transcript became cryptographically invalid against the LUKS volume. **Cost:** ~30 minutes of rotation work + permanent transcript-history annotation. Audit record: Day-4 close commit `98c79b2` + `.agents/decisions/2026-05-17-path-b-rotation-1.md`.
    77	
    78	**Path B was the right call for Day 4 ONLY because the protocol violation was acknowledged and the rotation was committed in the same session.** The Day-4 close commit (`98c79b2`) is the audit record. **Future sessions MUST avoid Path B by defaulting to Path A or Path D.** If Path B is invoked, the same-session-rotation discipline above is non-negotiable.
    79	
    80	### §2.3 — Path D (default for credential generation)
    81	
    82	**Definition:** Credential generated on the remote VPS (or other target system) via `openssl rand` or equivalent. Never echoed to stdout. Stored in a file with mode 0600 root:root. Founder retrieves separately via `sudo cat` in their own terminal, saves to 1Password, then deletes the temp file.
    83	
    84	**Use cases:**
    85	- Postgres role passwords (Day-5 §5.4 `ifos_app` role)
    86	- LUKS passphrase rotation (Day-5 §11 LUKS rotation post-Path-B)
    87	- Future API token generation
    88	- Any random-generated credential
    89	
    90	**Mechanism (worked example from Day-5 §5.4):**
    91	
    92	```bash
    93	# Inside an SSH session as maddox on the VPS:
    94	PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)                              # generate; not echoed
    95	printf '%s' "$PASSWORD" | sudo tee /vault/.<name>.tmp >/dev/null # write file; tee output discarded
    96	sudo chmod 600 /vault/.<name>.tmp                                # restrict access
    97	sudo chown root:root /vault/.<name>.tmp                          # root-only
    98	sudo -u postgres psql <<SQL                                      # use via stdin heredoc (not ps-visible)
    99	ALTER ROLE <role> WITH PASSWORD '$PASSWORD';
   100	SQL
   101	unset PASSWORD                                                    # clear from shell env
   102	```
   103	
   104	Founder retrieval (separate terminal, separate SSH session):
   105	
   106	```bash
   107	ssh ... 'sudo cat /vault/.<name>.tmp'   # founder views password
   108	# (founder copies to 1Password)
   109	ssh ... 'sudo rm /vault/.<name>.tmp'    # founder deletes temp file
   110	```
   111	
   112	**Properties:**
   113	- Password never appears in Claude Code's output stream
   114	- `ps auxf` cannot show the password (stdin heredoc, not command-line argument)
   115	- Temp file is on the LUKS-encrypted volume (encrypted at rest)
   116	- Founder retrieves at their convenience; no blocking handoff
   117	- Rotation NOT required because password was never in chat context
   118	
   119	**Trade-off:** ~2-minute founder retrieval at convenience vs. zero chat exposure.

   575	
   576	`validate.sh` hard-fails on missing calls. This is what enables the v2.0 LoRA pipeline — no decision log, no SFT corpus, no Scale-tier moat.
   577	
   578	**Change 3 — Escalation codes expand to recruitment vocabulary.** ~20–30 codes. Examples:
   579	
   580	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` — voice classifier score below threshold after retries
   581	- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — OAuth token expired/revoked
   582	- `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — high-confidence dedup needs human review
   583	- `ESC_JSL_RED_FLAG` — Supply Chain Auditor detected red flag
   584	- `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` — Brief Decoder cannot confidently shortlist
   585	- `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` — output references PII outside firm boundary
   586	- `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` — upstream API rate-limited (esp. LinkedIn)
   587	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — agent produced output violating vertical schema
   588	
   589	Build the catalogue in Week 0. New codes only when production demands one.

   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).

    13	## Section 1 — Context and sequencing criteria
    14	
    15	### 1.1 — What we're deciding
    16	
    17	Master brief §8.2 (lines 597-611) names six v1.0 agents and assigns build weeks:
    18	
    19	| # | Agent | Weeks (master brief §8.2) | Key dependency | Why this order (master brief verbatim) |
    20	|---|---|---|---|---|
    21	| A1 | Diagnostic | 3-4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | "Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters" |
    22	| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
    23	| A3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable" |
    24	| A4 | Cash Conductor | 7-8 | Xero + Open Banking | "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'" |
    25	| A5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | "First daytime always-on agent" |
    26	| A6 | Concierge | 10-13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build" |
    27	
    28	Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
    29	
    30	**Three sub-decisions in this document:**
    31	
    32	- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
    33	- **B. Sequence for agents 2-6.** The remaining five agents in some order across Weeks 5-13. Three candidate orderings compared in §3.
    34	- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
    35	
    36	### 1.2 — Why this matters now
    37	
    38	Three reasons the sequencing decision lands this week, not later:
    39	
    40	**Week 3 needs a starting agent.** The renderer (ADR-003) lands Week 1-2; `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` land Week 1-2; Postgres `decision_log` lands Day 4 Week 0. By Week 3 the substrate is live and waiting for its first user. Without §A (first agent), Week 3 doesn't have a build target.
    41	
    42	**Weeks 5-13 planning is speculative without §B.** Each agent's prerequisites (Bullhorn MCP, Fathom/Fireflies, Xero, LinkedIn) have lead times. Bullhorn MCP work itself starts Week 1 per Ultraplan §9 line 724 ("Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it"). Without knowing the agent build order, those infrastructure prereqs can't be sequenced.
    43	
    44	**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
    45	
    46	The Day-7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 Day 7 / Ultraplan §12) doesn't directly test sequencing — but Q4 ("Have we scoped the Agent Bundle v2 refactor and is the work <5 days?") and the Week-0 deliverable list at Ultraplan §9 line 737-741 both assume a sequenced plan exists. The Day 7 review surfaces this document for Codex ratification.
    47	
    48	### 1.3 — Sequencing criteria
    49	
    50	Six criteria to evaluate each agent against in §2. Each criterion scored High / Medium / Low or with a concrete number; substantive cells in §2 must justify the score by reference to master brief / Ultraplan / Product Spec / Day-2 Bullhorn decision.
    51	
    52	| # | Criterion | What it measures | Why it informs sequencing |
    53	|---|---|---|---|
    54	| 1 | **Implementation simplicity** | Lines of agent code in `agent.md` workflow + number of MCP servers touched + complexity of output contract (single-output vs multi-stage vs lifecycle-state) | Simpler agents land faster and exercise less substrate at once — better first-agent candidates because failure modes are easier to isolate |
    55	| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
    56	| 3 | **Risk de-risking** | Which named risks the agent's success/failure surfaces — Risk #1 (cortextOS primitives), Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth), Risk #5 (renderer-not-built) — per `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` | Building risk-surfacing agents earlier converts known-unknowns into known-knowns; building risk-deferring agents earlier preserves optionality but pushes the surprise window later |
    57	| 4 | **Commercial value** | Whether the agent's output is demoable to a design partner / first paying customer per Product Spec §2.2 R-rows | Earlier commercial-value agents accelerate the first-pilot conversion (Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12); but commercial-value agents are typically the more complex ones, conflicting with criterion 1 |
    58	| 5 | **Dependencies on other agents** | Does this agent's output feed another agent? Does this agent require another agent's output to function? | Agents with downstream dependents should ship before their dependents; agents with no upstream dependencies are good first candidates |
    59	| 6 | **Tenant-onboarding readiness** | Can this agent be deployed to one tenant without all infrastructure being live? (E.g. does it need the wiki API in v1.0 weeks 11-13, or only the Week-1-2 substrate?) | Earlier-readiness agents can pilot in shadow mode against the first design partner before all v1.0 infra is complete |
    60	
    61	The six criteria intentionally tension against each other — implementation simplicity (1) trades off against commercial value (4); substrate exercise (2) trades off against risk-isolation (3). The §2 per-agent assessments make the trade-offs visible per agent; the §3 sequencing options weight them differently; the §4 recommendation picks one weighting.
    62	
    63	### 1.4 — Scope cuts and v1.0 minimum
    64	
    65	Per master brief §12 / Ultraplan §10 row #2 (the four-risks-that-kill-v1.0 table), the **documented v1.0 scope-cut contingency** is verbatim:
    66	
    67	> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
    68	
    69	There are actually **two named contingency paths**, corresponding to two different failing risks:
    70	
    71	- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
    72	- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
    73	
    74	Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
    75	
    76	The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
    77	
    78	### 1.5 — One small but real finding before §2 begins
    79	
    80	Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
    81	
    82	Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
    83	
    84	**Section 4's recommendation evaluates both orderings** (founder-prompt-Alpha and master-brief-Alpha) against the §1.3 criteria, picks whichever wins on the merits, and explicitly aligns with the master brief by default unless rationale exists to revise it. This document is the "confirm or revise" decision per master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 — both options are on the table.
    85	
    86	---
    87	
    88	## Section 2 — Per-agent readiness assessment
    89	
    90	Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.

 succeeded in 300ms:
   498	- **Build complexity:** **M** (1 week)
   499	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn ToS — we cannot store profile data beyond the audit. Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.
   500	
   501	#### A2. The Janitor — the wedge agent
   502	
   503	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 5–6)
   504	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — scheduled nightly cron
   505	- **Trigger type:** Cron 02:00 UTC daily; manual full-cleanup on demand
   506	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None (scheduled batch)
   507	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read-write), Companies House (for entity enrichment)
   508	- **Shared modules required:** Decision log writer, escalation router
   509	- **External APIs:** Bullhorn REST API, Companies House
   510	- **Gate A:** dedup confidence score ≥ 0.85 on every merge proposal; no merge proposed where candidate has had activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag
   511	- **Gate B target:** day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement
   512	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the Bullhorn MCP work is the rate-limiting piece
   513	- **Gotchas:** Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0. Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself. Dedup is hard; start conservative (high-confidence merges only) and tune up.
   514	
   515	#### A3. The Scribe — the data spine
   535	- **MCP tools required:** Xero / QuickBooks / Sage (one of, per tenant), bank-feed connector
   536	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   537	- **External APIs:** Xero API or QuickBooks API or Sage API; bank feed via Open Banking (TrueLayer / Plaid UK)
   538	- **Gate A:** chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact; never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h
   539	- **Gate B target:** tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline
   540	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — three accounting integrations × Open Banking is the work
   541	- **Gotchas:** Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial. Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic; start with exact-amount matches and expand to fuzzy.
   542	
   555	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl. Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas. Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it.
   556	
   557	#### A6. The Concierge — no candidate ghosted
   558	
   559	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 9–10)
   560	- **Always-on?** Tier 1 — persistent state across the candidate lifecycle
   561	- **Trigger type:** ATS state changes (candidate moved to interview, rejected, placed, etc.) + cron sweep for time-elapsed nurture events
   562	- **CortexOS primitives required:** Persistent PTY (#1), context rotation (#2), approval gates (#4), Telegram surface (#5)
   563	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read for state, write for activity log), Microsoft Graph / Gmail (send), AgentMail (optional for agent-identity sends)
   564	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   565	- **External APIs:** Microsoft Graph or Google Workspace per tenant; AgentMail for v1.1+
   566	- **Gate A:** every lifecycle event has a draft generated within 30 minutes; voice classifier score ≥ 0.75; correct addressee resolution (no candidates emailed under another's name)
   567	- **Gate B target:** <5% candidate-ghosted rate; ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts
   568	- **Build complexity:** **XL** (4 weeks) — this is the biggest v1.0 agent because of the lifecycle state machine and the breadth of comms types (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6)
   569	- **Gotchas:** Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks. Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case — get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship.

RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.

Vertical-schema v0.2 voice corpus substrate + migration SQL (`45b59e0`). **Risk #5 stays at High** per the staged ladder: ADR-003 line 145 requires BOTH "renderer code committed" (now ✓) AND "Diagnostic agent renders cleanly (Week 4)" for High → Medium. Diagnostic bundle does not yet exist (gated on Q1 design partner LOI per Risk #3). When Diagnostic first renders cleanly at W4, severity drops to Medium. Three implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: (a) CLI-name divergence (`ifos-render-agent` standalone vs `cortextos-ifos render-agent` per ADR-003 §3.3.1; submodule read-only boundary prevents the latter); (b) `_shared/` symlink target counting error in ADR-003 §3.3.3 (spec says `../../_shared`, correct is `../../../_shared` — 3 vs 4 levels); (c) phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `cortextos-ifos list-agents` (renderer correctness unaffected; cosmetic). **Owner:** Claude Code Day 8 commit chain shipped; founder for Diagnostic-build green-light when Q1 turns YES. |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:25:| 10 | **`recent_edit` raw PII retention vs UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) data minimisation** — `vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml` §1 `recent_edit` entity stores `original_text` + `edited_text` verbatim (length-capped 8192 chars), each potentially containing candidate names, salaries, contact info. v0.2 default is indefinite retention to support v2.0 LoRA SFT corpus. Arguably violates GDPR data-minimisation requirement absent retention rules + redaction protocol. | **Medium** (probability GDPR enforcement action depends on pilot scale + regulator interest) | **High** (regulator notification + fines + reputational damage; potential pilot LOI block) | First pilot LOI signing window approaches AND external advisor (D2) hasn't engaged AND PII retention decision (D3) is unresolved. | **Surfaced by Codex Round 1** (`logs/codex-ratification/manual-run/docs_verticals_recruitment_vertical_schema_v0_2_supplement_yaml.output.md` issue 4). Resolution path: bundle Founder Decision D2 (external advisor engagement) + D3 (90-day text purge vs indefinite vs pilot-controlled) in `2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md`. **Pre-LOI blocker per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §3.4 external-advisor must-fill.** Recommended: D2-A + D3-D (engage advisor this week; D3 decision follows advisor's recommendation; likely D3-B = 90-day text purge + indefinite metadata). **Owner:** founder for D2 + D3; Claude Code for implementation once decisions land. **Source:** Codex Round-1 ratification of v0.2 supplement; also master brief §3 vault/Postgres split + autosend §10 pilot-agreement liability placeholder. |
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:33:| 11 | **Tenant-context guard failure due transactionless `SET LOCAL` usage** — scripts and helpers used `SET LOCAL ifos.tenant_slug` in psql heredocs/strings without visible `BEGIN/COMMIT`. If PostgreSQL treats the setting as transaction-local with no active transaction, RLS-protected reads/writes can return zero rows, fail audit inserts, or silently fall back to JSONL. | ~~High~~ → Low post-remediation | High | Any psql call with `SET LOCAL` not bracketed by `BEGIN/COMMIT`, or a successful operation whose decision_log row falls back because RLS rejected the insert. | Round-2 remediation Fix 3-5 wraps every `SET LOCAL` psql call in a transaction.

docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:34:| 12 | **PII purge remediation cannot execute against current schema** — `v0.2-to-v0.3-pii-purge.sql` adds `text_purged_at` and a CHECK requiring text fields to be NULL after purge, but v0.2 declares `recent_edit.original_text TEXT NOT NULL`; the purge script sets `original_text=NULL`. | ~~High~~ → Low post-remediation | ~~High~~ → Low for cron execution; legal posture still depends on D2/D3 | `v0.2-to-v0.3-pii-purge.sql` executed without `ALTER COLUMN original_text DROP NOT NULL`. | Round-2 remediation Fix 2 adds `ALTER COLUMN DROP NOT NULL` before the CHECK constraint.

docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:46:- Two-instance PATH conflict for bus commands → **Updated 2026-05-16 evening:** folds into the renderer's CLAUDE.md preamble responsibility (ADR-003 design §2.1-A). The preamble draft in design §2.3 sets `CTX_AGENT_DIR` explicitly; rendered hook scripts source `_shared/` helpers via `${CTX_AGENT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/_shared/` rather than relying on `PATH` resolution. Quirk 3 is no longer a Week-1 risk — it's a renderer test case.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:55:- 2026-05-22 (Day 11) — **Codex Round 2 autonomous ratification complete.** 26 artefacts reviewed; 17 RATIFIED / 9 REJECTED. Manifest §1.7 appended and full outputs written to `logs/codex-ratification/round-2-autonomous/`. D5 skill softening ratified. Bullhorn gate disagreement rejected because the promised source-doc sharpening did not land. Autosend policy, v0.2 supplement, approval bridge, PII purge runbook/script/forward migration, and tenancy audit script remain rejected. **New Risk #11** added for transactionless `SET LOCAL` usage across live DB scripts/helpers. **New Risk #12** added for the PII purge migration/script mismatch with `recent_edit.original_text NOT NULL`.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:56:- 2026-05-22 (Day 11 evening) — **Codex Round-2 remediation applied + Round 3 verified.** Fixes wrap all identified `SET LOCAL` calls in explicit transactions and make `recent_edit.original_text` nullable before PII purge; Risks #11 and #12 moved to mitigated. Founder-domain D1/D2/D3 remain open and are explicitly annotated in the affected artefacts.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:61:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:66:- 2026-05-20 (Day 8 evening) — **Codex ratification Round 1 complete + remediation landed.** 16 artefacts reviewed (Cluster A+B+C); 2 RATIFIED (ADR-004, brain-ui-scope); 14 REJECTED. Remediation commit `2b287d3` incorporates 13 of 14 rejections (Bucket 1 cosmetic + Bucket 2 ADR-004 back-propagation + Bucket 3 structural). 2 disagreement docs filed (`codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-decision-doc-shape-on-audits.md` + `codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md`). 5 founder decisions surfaced (D1-D5 in `2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md`). **NEW Risk #10 candidate surfaced by Codex** (recent_edit raw PII retention vs UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) data minimisation) — see Risk #10 below. Manifest queue updated with per-artefact Round-1 verdicts (`docs/decisions/2026-05-18-codex-ratification-manifest.md` §1.5). Round 2 expected to take 14 REJECTED → 0-2 REJECTED.

Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511).

Lines 179-188 store `original_text` and `edited_text` verbatim, and line 208 admits these can include names and salaries. This violates the autosend `payload_preview` PII discipline unless retention/redaction is enforced. Fix by adding redaction rules or making Q13's 90-day purge/legal review a pre-ratification blocker."
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:70:**Real issue:** `recent_edit.original_text` + `edited_text` are CAPPED at 8192 chars but otherwise stored verbatim. The agent's draft AND the consultant's edited version. Both can contain PII (candidate names, salaries, contact info). Indefinite retention for LoRA SFT training. UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) "data minimisation" arguably requires bounded retention.

docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:80:**Cost of delay:** Same as D2 — Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03. If LOI lands before D3 resolves, founder ships v1.0 with D3-A indefinite retention, which is the worst legal posture. Bundle D2 + D3 resolution.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:25:  - System agent names (e.g., `_renderer` per ADR-003 + Day-5 schema migration) are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only. This schema covers tenant-domain entities; system-internal agents are out of scope.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:321:        notes: v0.1 is essentially a tag for Concierge addressee-resolution gating; v1.1 Triage agent owns expansion (sub-fields for decision-domain, budget authority, etc.).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:334:        source: IFOS-derived (Concierge addressee-resolution gate per bullhorn §4.1 A6)
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:337:      - v1.0 is intentionally thin — only the fields Concierge addressee-resolution needs for orange-tier sends.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:806:    rationale: Notes operationally ARE the audit trail (autosend-policy.md §7 confirms); decision_log has RLS + tier metadata + payload_hash for audit; avoid dual-storage problem at v1.0; cheap to promote later if needed.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:816:    decision: System agent names like `_renderer` are NOT entity_types in this schema. They appear in `decision_log.agent_name` only, with `phase` from the live 5-value enum (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff` per Day-4 §6.3 + Day-5 migration). The sentinel `_renderer` writes `phase='gating_failed'` for failures and `phase='action'` for successful renders per ADR-004 Decision 7.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:817:    rationale: Vertical schema covers tenant-domain entities only. System-internal agents (renderer, validators, ingest pipeline) live in decision_log audit but are not first-class business entities.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:856:    rationale: v1.0 Concierge addressee-resolution uses primary-decision-maker; panel modelling adds value when v1.1 Triage handles inbound brief queries from multiple stakeholders.

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:54:- **§1.1-A:** master brief §8.1 names `validate.sh` and `context.sh` at the bundle root but does not specify the **invocation mechanism** — i.e. how does the agent invoke them from within its Claude Code session? Claude Code's hooks convention is `.claude/hooks/*.sh`; cortextOS templates don't use that path (they use `.claude/skills/` for skill scripts but not `.claude/hooks/` for lifecycle hooks). Recommended resolution in §2.1: render the two scripts to `.claude/hooks/` so they integrate with Claude Code's hook discovery; CLAUDE.md preamble (synthesised from agent.md per §2.1) references them by name.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:55:- **§1.1-B:** master brief §8.1 mentions `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` and `_shared/voice-loader.sh` but does not specify where `_shared/` lives in the rendered output. The bundle's `validate.sh` and `context.sh` `source` these helpers — the renderer needs to materialise the path. Recommended resolution: place `_shared/` at `${projectRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/_shared/` (one per org, symlinked into every agent dir's `.claude/hooks/_shared/`); rendered hook scripts source via `${CTX_AGENT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/_shared/<helper>.sh`.

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:123:- **§2.1-A:** master brief §8.1 does not specify what the **cortextOS preamble template** looks like — the wrapper around `agent.md` that becomes `CLAUDE.md`. Recommended resolution: pin a canonical preamble at `packages/agent-renderer/templates/claude-md-preamble.md` (rendered with tenant + agent variables); preamble content must (a) tell Claude Code to source `.claude/hooks/context.sh` at session start, (b) tell Claude Code to call `.claude/hooks/validate.sh` before any tool invocation (Gate A), (c) list the env vars the agent should expect (`CTX_TENANT_SLUG`, `CTX_AGENT_NAME`, `CTX_ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT`, etc.), (d) reference `agent.md` body verbatim, (e) **not** reference IDENTITY.md / SOUL.md / MEMORY.md / GOALS.md / etc. because they will not exist. A draft preamble lives in §2.3 worked example below.

Recommended resolution: `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-{client, voice, notifications, vault, ats, accounting, target-patch}.json` per Ultraplan §5.3 line 357-364 enumeration. The renderer resolves `$ref` to these paths during schema materialisation.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:125:- **§2.1-C:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 names `_voice/`, `_playbooks/`, `_decisions/`, `_config.yaml` under `/vault/{tenant}/` but does not enumerate `_secrets.env`. Recommended resolution: add `_secrets.env` to the per-tenant vault skeleton; created at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 line 263 `provision-tenant.sh {slug}` step 2). Mode `0600` owned by `ifos-tenant-{slug}`.

Additionally, a sampling check fires (1-in-N per `action_type`; default N=10). On sampling, the action is enqueued for **human spot-check review** by the tenant operator within 24 hours of execution. Spot-check disagreement triggers retrospective review of the policy tier classification (potential tier elevation via tenant override).

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:260:3. Telegram bot (master brief primitive 5) notifies tenant operator via the chat ID in `tenant_adapters[autosend_policy].config.approval_routing.default_recipient`
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:262:5. On resolution, `decision_log` row is **appended** (not modified — append-only) with `phase='action'`, `payload.approval_status='approved'|'rejected'|'escalated'` and `payload.approval_resolution_at`

Pointer to a Telegram chat ID (or other channel via tenant_adapters expansion). Sourced from `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env` at render time per ADR-003 Decision 3 §2.1.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:470:Overrides take effect at next agent session boundary (cortextOS PTY restart).

Override changes are themselves logged to `decision_log` with `phase='trigger'`, `agent_name='_tenant_admin'`, `payload.action='autosend_policy_override_changed'`.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:482:- **Orange** (per-action approval) requires the cortextOS approval gate to be wired with IFOS-specific approval categories. The gate primitive ships per Day 1 audit (`src/bus/approval.ts`), but the routing logic + Telegram bot configuration per tenant + tenant_adapters approval_routing wiring is non-trivial.
docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:487:- **Orange tier:** approval gate driven by policy lookup. Implementation tasks: `autosend_await_approval` function, `tenant_adapters[autosend_policy].config.approval_routing` resolution, Telegram bot inline-button handling, timeout enforcement.

docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md:586:5. **PII liability for `payload_preview` formatting.** If `payload_preview` accidentally leaks PII into `decision_log`, that's a Provider liability event. Tooling: linter on `payload_preview` strings at hook-helpers.sh layer.

Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:40:**Week 3 needs a starting agent.** The renderer (ADR-003) lands Week 1-2; `_shared/voice-loader.sh` + `hook-helpers.sh` land Week 1-2; Postgres `decision_log` lands Day 4 Week 0. By Week 3 the substrate is live and waiting for its first user. Without §A (first agent), Week 3 doesn't have a build target.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:55:| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:98:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High for Risk #5; None for Risk #1+#2** | **First production exercise of the renderer** per ADR-003 design §5.2 line "First production render is the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4." Renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log working end-to-end means Risk #5 staged reduction trigger from RISK-REGISTER fires (Medium severity). Doesn't touch Risk #2 (no Bullhorn) or Risk #1 (no Tier-1 primitives) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:101:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **High** | Runnable from end of Week 2 with renderer + `_shared/` + Postgres decision_log. No vault `_secrets.env` complexity (no per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth needed), no wiki API needed. Single-tenant deployable immediately |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.

First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:348:2. **First production run lands clean** for at least one tenant — no `ESC_*` escalation rows in `decision_log` for agent N's run.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:349:3. **Decision_log entries showing N successful runs** without escalation — N specified per-transition in §5.2.

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:59:**Escalation path if PAUSE extends:** if unfreeze not achieved within 4 weeks of PAUSE activation, strategic review reconvenes. Outcomes: (a) continue PAUSE if pipeline is materially active; (b) escalate to KILL if no pipeline activity; (c) escalate to PIVOT if pipeline rejection signals point to a different vertical/ATS.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:63:**Threshold:** Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic --tenant <slug>` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14). "Cleanly" means: renderer exits 0, no `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` rows in `decision_log`, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures. (CLI name per ADR-004 Decision 1; earlier drafts named this `cortextos-ifos render-agent` which violated master brief §3.1 boundary 1.)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:69:**Action:** KILL state. Rationale: the renderer architecture (ADR-003) was ratified in Week 0 Day 1 evening as the load-bearing Week-1 prerequisite. If Week 3 ends with no clean Diagnostic render, the renderer has fundamental gaps that the design did not anticipate. The renderer cannot be "patched"; v1.0 cannot ship without working render. Continuing into Weeks 4+ without resolution is sunk-cost reasoning.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:101:**Unfreeze criterion:** Strategic review by Founder + Jack within 2 weeks of PAUSE activation produces one of three outcomes:
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:111:**Owner:** IFOS oncall + tenant operator. Daily check via `decision_log` queries: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_log WHERE phase='gating_failed' AND payload->>'tier'='red' AND payload->>'block_reason'='red_tier_classification' AND tenant_slug=? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:121:**Threshold:** Cost-per-completed-action (defined as: total IFOS infrastructure + API + Claude inference cost ÷ count of `decision_log` rows with `phase='action'` and `payload.tier IN ('green','yellow','orange-approved')`) exceeds **£0.50 per action** after 4 tenant-weeks of operation.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:176:**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:235:**Must-fill before first pilot LOI signs.** The pilot agreement may reference an external advisor for dispute resolution per `autosend-safety-policy.md` §10 placeholder language. Founder identifies and engages within Weeks 1-2.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:21:**Sub-decision B — OAuth flow.** Master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 pre-states a recommendation: "browser dance for production, service-account for dev." This is the authorization-code grant (per-tenant browser dance, refresh-token cycle) for production tenants, plus client-credentials grant (service account) for IFOS-internal sandbox/dev work. Sub-decision B verifies that recommendation against Bullhorn's actual OAuth implementation and pins the per-tenant token storage path (per `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution: `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`, mode `0600`).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:149:- **Per-tenant model.** Each tenant has its own `corpToken` and its own per-tenant `restUrl` returned by /login. Operations are scoped by the corpToken; IFOS must hold per-tenant token state. This maps cleanly to the per-tenant credential model already pinned in `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution (`/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`, mode `0600`).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:224:This rotation pattern matters operationally: IFOS must persist the **most recent** refresh_token after every token refresh, atomically overwriting the previous one in `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env`. A failure between obtaining the new refresh_token and persisting it permanently invalidates the previous one — the tenant admin must re-run the browser dance. **Spec gap §3.1-A:** the renderer + auth module need a refresh-token-persistence atomicity protocol. Recommended resolution: write to `_secrets.env.tmp` then rename, matching the atomic write pattern in `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §3.3.4.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:250:- **Production tenants:** authorization-code grant per §3.1. Per-tenant admin runs the browser dance during onboarding wizard Day 2 (Product Spec §5.2 OAuth + vault provisioning step). Refresh tokens persisted at `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env` mode 0600 with atomic-rename rotation per Spec gap §3.1-A resolution.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:271:**Status: Proposed.** Status flips to Accepted on commercial verification answers to the four questions above. Most likely outcome: confirmation of the §3.4 recommendation as stated, with one or two clarifications absorbed into the renderer's auth-module implementation.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:317:Restated from `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §2.1 + §3.3.2 spec gap §2.1-C resolution + §3.1 of this document:

The old refresh_token is unusable after the new one is generated — atomicity is mandatory.

Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:167:### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:169:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:205:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the §12 voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires per `escalation-codes.md` ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT trigger — ≥5 `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7-day window (per the nightly voice-drift cron). Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT directly.

docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:17:Intel Force OS is the always-on operating system for UK recruitment agencies. It runs on CortexOS as the persistent agent runtime, lives inside each firm's existing stack (Bullhorn / Vincere / Voyager Infinity, Xero / Sage, Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace), and ships as two coordinated product lines — **IntelForce Recruit** for the front office and **IntelForce Temp** for the back office. Together they replace the operational drag of an entire junior team and, more importantly, generate revenue: surfaced BD opportunities, intercepted competitor briefs, faster cash collection, dormant-candidate reactivation, and post-placement nurture that compounds into referrals. The firm pays £499–£6,950/month per front-office tier and a separate £1,950–£5,950/month for the temp sub-platform. Every agent is pitched against a single, quantified outcome the buyer can verify within 90 days. Configuration scales because the moat is the per-vertical schema, not per-customer plumbing — onboarding becomes a 5-day wizard, not a 5-week project.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:396:**Rename-safety mechanism** (recommended): the `update-entity` operation, when the `display_name` field changes, triggers a `rewrite-backlinks` job that walks all pages with this entity in `linked_entities` and replaces the link text. The stable anchor is the `id` field — backlinks resolution always goes via id, not display name. The on-disk markdown is the human-facing artefact; the Postgres `entity_graph` table holds the id-based relationship truth.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:398:**Spec gap 2.2-A:** master brief §5 does not specify the rewrite-backlinks mechanism. Recommended resolution: implement as part of `update-entity` in `packages/brain/wiki/lib/update.ts` v1.0.

The `entity-history` operation reads from the Postgres `decision_log` table, **not** from a separate per-entity history file. This is why the master brief's `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 is a spec gap (2.1-B) — there are two candidates for "where history lives" and only one of them is in the master brief.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:538:**Source of truth:** filesystem markdown is canonical for the link presence; Postgres `entity_links` is the index. Resolution (display_name → id) is the IFOS-specific value-add — without it, `[[Sarah Bowen]]` is just a string.

agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Each draft is written to vault at `/vault/<tenant>/concierge-drafts/<draft_id>.md` (canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split); approval routes through the autosend-bridge (Founder Decision D1 path) and on approval the send executes via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; agent-identity email adapter (deferred) deferred to v1.1+). Drafts are yellow-tier `concierge_email_draft` (internal, voice-classified, sample-spot-checked); the customer-facing send is orange-tier (`gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` or `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` depending on channel per autosend-policy.yaml lines 122-149). Gate A hard-fails any draft with voice classifier below the position-specific threshold (≥0.75 standard / ≥0.82 sensitive) OR any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). The 30-minute SLA from lifecycle event to draft is a Gate B leading metric (warning + aggregated; NOT a Gate A hard-fail) per the same ULTRAPLAN line — making it a hard-fail would block legitimate delayed drafts caused by Bullhorn polling fallbacks. Gate B success thresholds: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts + ≥90% 30-min SLA hit (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a draft's voice classifier score is below the position-specific threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Concierge does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Concierge.

   269	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.
   270	
   271	### Open questions for founder review
   272	
   273	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   274	|---|---|---|
   275	| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
   276	| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
   277	| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
   278	| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
   279	| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
   280	| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |
   281	
   282	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
   283	
   284	1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
   285	2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
   286	3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

   290	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   291	
   292	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.
   293	
   294	Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
   295	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   296	- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
   297	- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer
   298	
   299	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   300	- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   301	- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   302	- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
   303	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)
   304	
   305	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

codex
REJECTED

1. Schema-before-code violation: Janitor assumes `candidate.linkedin_url` / `current_company` fields that are not in the ratified schema. Lines 100 and 128-132 use `candidate.linkedin_url` and write back `current_company`, but `vertical-schema.yaml` has candidate email/phone/location and no `linkedin_url` or `current_company`. Add these fields in a v0.3 schema supplement before referencing them, or remove/defer the LinkedIn match/write path.

2. Tacit-note source fields are mis-specified. Lines 16 and 59 say notes are harvested from `decision_log` resolution events with `outcome='approved_after_edit'`, but `approved_after_edit` is `recent_edit.resolution`, not a `decision_log.outcome` value. Rewrite §1/§3 to use `recent_edit.resolution='approved_after_edit'`; keep `decision_log` only for action-context/audit joins.

3. Janitor reads `recent_edit` without schema access registration. Lines 134-138 directly query `recent_edit`, but the v0.2 supplement’s `recent_edit.v1_0_agent_access` lists voice-drift-canary, Concierge, and LoRA pipeline, not Janitor. Add Janitor R access in the schema supplement before this agent depends on that table.

4. Autosend policy citations are inaccurate. Line 16 cites `autosend-safety-policy.yaml`, which is not the shared policy file; line 69 claims `bullhorn_candidate_dedupe` is at `autosend-policy.yaml line 69`, but it is at `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 111-115. Correct the policy filename/path and line anchors.

5. `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` is used for the wrong trigger. Line 187 says merge-confidence rejects fire `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED`, while the catalogue defines that code for confidence `≥0.85` human-review-required cases; line 213 then contradicts line 187 by saying it is not used for `<0.85` rejects. Use `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` only for high-confidence human-review cases, and silently drop or separately classify low-confidence rejects.

6. `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` trigger semantics drift from the catalogue. Lines 197 and 214 define a miss as either dedup `<15%` OR field-completeness `<10%`, but the registered catalogue trigger currently says Janitor misses when dedup `<15%` AND field-completeness `<10%`. Either update the catalogue and flag the amendment, or align Janitor’s §5/§6 wording to the registered trigger.
