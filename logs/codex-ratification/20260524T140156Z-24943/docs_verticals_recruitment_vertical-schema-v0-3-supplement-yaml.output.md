=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

---

*End of top-level SKILL.md. Apply the relevant type-specific skill next.*

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: schema-change ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-schema-change

Type-specific checks for: `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` + any v0.X supplement file (`vertical-schema.vN.M-supplement.yaml`).

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

---

## §1 — Schema layering invariant

IFOS vertical schemas layer above Day-4 §6.3 generic Postgres primitives:

```
entities (id, tenant_slug, entity_type, entity_id, data JSONB, version, ...)
entity_links (..., source_entity_type, source_entity_id, target_entity_type, target_entity_id, link_type, ...)
decision_log (..., agent_name, phase, payload JSONB, ...)
```

The vertical schema specifies (a) which `entity_type` slugs are valid, (b) what JSON shape `entities.data` takes per entity_type, (c) which `link_type` slugs are valid. **Schemas DO NOT create new Postgres tables in v0.X** — supplements that propose new tables (e.g., `voice_corpus`, `voice_corpus_chunks`, `tone_rule`, `recent_edit`) MUST be paired with explicit `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M-to-vN.M+1.sql` companion files OR explicitly mark the new tables as "auxiliary v0.X tables, not entities".

REJECT if a schema declares a new entity_type without naming whether it lives in `entities.data` JSONB OR in a new auxiliary table; the layering should be explicit.

---

## §2 — Per-entity required fields

Every entity_type definition MUST include:

- `description` — 1-2 sentence canonical definition in IFOS vocabulary
- `bullhorn_source` — exactly one of:
  - `Bullhorn.<Entity>` (with optional `where` clause)
  - `none (IFOS-derived from <source>)`
  - `none (IFOS-internal; not synced to ATS)`
- `v1_0_agent_access` — list of agents from master brief §8.2 with R / W / R+W disposition, OR explicit "none (v1.1+ exercise)"
- `canonical_fields` — at least 5 fields with type + required + source (Bullhorn path OR IFOS-derived)

REJECT if any of these are missing.

For each field within `canonical_fields`:

- `type` — one of `string | integer | number | boolean | array | object | timestamp | date`
- `required` — boolean
- `source` — `Bullhorn.<Entity>.<field>` OR `IFOS-derived` (with note on how)
- `notes` — optional but recommended for non-obvious fields

REJECT if any field lacks `type`, `required`, or `source`.

---

## §3 — JSON Schema compatibility (for entities.data shape)

Field types declared in the YAML must round-trip to valid JSON Schema. Cross-check against `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-*.json`:

- If a field's `type: array`, the YAML must imply item type (via `notes: Items: <type>`)
- If a field's `type: object`, the YAML must imply nested shape OR be explicitly free-form
- If a field references a `voice_classifier_score` or similar [0.0, 1.0] bounded value, confirm the migration SQL adds a CHECK constraint OR a trigger

REJECT if YAML field types cannot be expressed as JSON Schema for entities.data.

---

## §4 — Relationship definitions

`relationships:` (or `additional_relationships:` in supplements) defines `entity_links.link_type` values. Each MUST include:

- `source` — entity_type
- `target` — entity_type
- `cardinality` — `1:1 | 1:N | N:1 | M:N`
- `description` — 1-2 sentences
- `v1_0_exercise` — which agents use this link OR explicit "none (v1.1+)"

REJECT if cardinality is missing or contradicts the agent_access_matrix (e.g., cardinality says `1:N` from candidate → placement but matrix has both as R+W to placement, implying M:N).

Cross-referenced entities MUST exist in this schema OR a previous version (v0.1 for v0.2 supplement). REJECT if relationship references an undefined entity_type.

---

## §5 — Agent access matrix consistency

`agent_access_matrix:` must list every v1.0 agent (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge) + state R / W / R+W / none for every entity_type.

Cross-check:

- For each entity, the `v1_0_agent_access` field in §1 MUST match the matrix
- For each agent in the matrix, every entity from `entities:` MUST be present (no silent omissions)
- `Diagnostic` must have `none` or `R` for all entities — Diagnostic doesn't write to Bullhorn per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1
- `Janitor` must have R+W on `candidate` per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 A2
- `Scribe` must have R+W on `candidate` + `placement` per §4.1 A3
- `Concierge` must have R+W on `candidate` + `placement` per §4.1 A6

REJECT if matrix omits an agent, omits an entity, or contradicts the agent's specified bullhorn-integration role.

---

## §6 — Bullhorn mapping consistency

`bullhorn_mapping:` must align with `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §3 endpoint surface:

- Every entity with `bullhorn_source: Bullhorn.X` must have a mapping row in `bullhorn_mapping:`
- Field mappings (canonical IFOS field → Bullhorn field) must NOT contradict Bullhorn's actual API
- v1.0 endpoint surface is 4 entities (Candidate, ClientCorporation, JobOrder, Note + Placement extension). v0.X schemas with more `Bullhorn.X` sources than these need explicit deferral notes for v1.1+ entities.

REJECT if a `Bullhorn.X` source is named but no corresponding mapping row exists.

---

## §7 — Migration SQL pairing (for supplements that add entities)

Supplements (`vertical-schema.vN.M-supplement.yaml`) that add new entity_types MUST be paired with:

- `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M-to-vN.M+1.sql` (forward migration)
- `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/vN.M+1-to-vN.M.sql` (rollback)

The supplement MUST cite both file paths in a `migration:` section. REJECT if a supplement adds tables without naming the migration files.

If migration files exist, cross-check (don't deeply review — that's `review-postgres-migration` skill's job):

- Every new entity_type in the supplement → exactly one `CREATE TABLE` in the forward migration
- Every new field added to existing entities → either a JSONB key (preferred per Day-4 §6.3) OR a column ADD on `entities` (less common)
- The rollback SQL exists + is non-trivial (not just `-- TODO`)

REJECT if migration files are referenced but missing OR mismatch the supplement's declared additions.

---

## §8 — Open-question discipline

`open_questions:` (or `open_questions_vN.M_additions:` in supplements) entries MUST:

- Be numbered (Q1, Q2, ...) with no gaps
- State the question concretely (not "what should we do about X?" — instead "should X be A or B?")
- Name options (A / B / C with one-line descriptions)
- Have a `vN.M_default` (the default the schema currently encodes)
- Have a `trigger_for_revisit` (when do we revisit — named event/date, not "later")

REJECT if any question lacks options OR a default OR a trigger.

Sample-check: if the schema has 10+ open questions but most defaults are "TBD" or "founder decides during pilot", that's signal of insufficient design depth. REJECT and demand defaults.

---

## §9 — Voice corpus + voice score consistency (for v0.2 + later)

If the supplement defines voice_corpus / tone_rule / recent_edit (Phase 4 patterns):

- `voice_corpus` MUST have a `version` field (semver) + `is_active` boolean + at-most-one-active enforced (partial unique index in migration SQL)
- `voice_corpus` chunking_strategy enum must be exhaustive — listing only "paragraph" without "sentence-window-N" or "semantic-segment-vN" reserved is acceptable for v0.X but should name the reserved values
- `tone_rule.severity` must be `info | warn | block`; other values REJECT
- `tone_rule.applies_to_agents` — empty array = "all agents"; non-empty array = filter list. If the field allows null with different semantics, REJECT (ambiguity)
- `recent_edit` MUST be append-only in migration GRANTs (SELECT + INSERT only on `ifos_app` role)
- `recent_edit.resolution` must be exhaustive: `approved_verbatim | approved_after_edit | rejected | deferred`
- `voice_classifier_score` fields on entities must be `[0.0, 1.0]` bounded — REJECT if no CHECK constraint or trigger is named in migration

---

## §10 — Common false-RATIFY traps to watch for

- **Missing required field on entity** — `candidate.bullhorn_id` MUST be `required: true` (it's the round-trip primary key). If marked `false`, REJECT.

- **Inconsistent required + nullable** — `required: true` with a `notes: May be nullable for...` is contradictory. REJECT.

- **Source mismatch** — `source: Bullhorn.Candidate.email` on a field marked `IFOS-derived` is incoherent. REJECT.

- **PII flagging missing** — fields holding email/phone/name should have a `notes:` line referencing `autosend-safety-policy §7 payload_preview PII rules`. Not blocking on absence but flag in RATIFIED-with-notes.

- **Schema-validates-itself-fail** — try to mentally construct an `entities.data` JSON for the candidate entity using the schema's required fields. If you can't construct a valid example, REJECT.

---

## §11 — Quick checklist

- [ ] Status field present + matches content
- [ ] Layering invariant stated (entities/entity_links/decision_log primitives + JSONB shape OR new auxiliary tables)
- [ ] Every entity has description + bullhorn_source + v1_0_agent_access + canonical_fields (≥5 fields)
- [ ] Every field has type + required + source
- [ ] All relationships have source + target + cardinality
- [ ] Agent access matrix lists all 6 v1.0 agents × all entities
- [ ] Bullhorn mapping matches `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §3 surface
- [ ] Migration SQL files exist + are referenced (if supplement adds entities)
- [ ] Open questions all have options + default + trigger
- [ ] (For v0.2+) voice corpus + tone_rule + recent_edit invariants checked
- [ ] No PII fields without privacy notes (advisory only)

If all clear: RATIFIED.
If any fail: REJECTED with numbered issues citing specifics.

# §2 — Complete v0.3 agent access matrix
# ============================================================================
#
# Per review-schema-change skill §5: full matrix across all v1.0 agents
# and all v0.1 + v0.2 entities. v0.3 is a CUMULATIVE matrix that includes
# v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3 dispositions. Where this matrix differs from
# vertical-schema.yaml v0.1 §3, the cell is an EXPLICIT v0.3 amendment
# with a marker comment in-line. Full list of v0.3 amendments:
#
# Cells changed from v0.1 baseline:
#   - Diagnostic client: none → R (reads Companies House data via cached
#     client entity; sales-tool source-of-truth context — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Diagnostic contact: none → R (reads §11 decision-maker map context)
#   - Diagnostic opportunity: none → R (reads prospect-firm opportunity if exists)
#   - Janitor contact: R → R+W (dedup + field-backfill on contacts; same
#     pattern as candidate/contractor — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Janitor opportunity: none → R (reads opportunity context for cleanup)
#   - Janitor placement: R → R+W (lifecycle-state cleanup writes —
#     v0.3 amendment)
#   - Janitor timesheet: none → R (reads for placement-state inference)
#   - Scribe Contact: none → R+W (writes preferred_channel + next_action_target_date
#     ONLY; decision_authority remains v0.1-owned by founder/v1.1 Triage)
#   - Scribe Brief: R → R+W (writes must_haves + nice_to_haves + deal_breakers
#     ONLY; existing salary_min/max + start_date_target remain Bullhorn-sourced,
#     R-only for Scribe)
#   - Scribe Opportunity: none → R+W (writes 3 new prospecting-call fields)
#   - Scribe timesheet: none → R (reads for placement-context resolution
#     on check-in calls)
#   - Cash Conductor contact: none → R (reads for invoice addressee resolution
#     — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Cash Conductor placement: none → R (reads for client linkage on invoice)
#   - Cash Conductor timesheet: none → R (reads to verify billable hours
#     match invoiced amounts)
#   - Sourcing Scout candidate: R → R+W (writes proposed-candidate rows
#     from multi-source aggregation — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Sourcing Scout contractor: R → R+W (same; contractor-mode briefs)
#   - Sourcing Scout opportunity: none → R (reads opportunity context for ICP)
#   - Concierge candidate: R → R+W (writes lifecycle-state-derived fields +
#     activity-log links per concierge §4 Step 13-14 — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Concierge contractor: R → R+W (lifecycle states for contractor placements)
#   - Concierge opportunity: none → R (reads for outbound lifecycle-event context)
#   - Concierge placement: R → R+W (writes Bullhorn state advancement per
#     concierge §4 Step 14 — v0.3 amendment)
#   - Concierge timesheet: none → R (reads to verify placement-progress for
#     7d/30d/90d nurture)
#   - Janitor recent_edit: + R access (was Concierge/canary/LoRA only — v0.2
#     extended)
#   - Janitor tone_rule: + R access (was Scribe/Cash Conductor/Concierge only
#     — v0.2 extended)
#
# All other access levels carry forward unchanged from v0.1 + v0.2.

agent_access_matrix:

  # Disposition tokens: R | W | R+W | none
  #
  # SCOPE: This matrix is rectangular across `entities:` entity_types ONLY
  # (candidate, contractor, client, contact, brief, opportunity, placement,
  # timesheet — 8 v0.1 entity_types). v0.2 voice_corpus / tone_rule /
  # recent_edit are defined in v0.2 supplement as AUXILIARY POSTGRES TABLES,
  # NOT entities.data entity_types (see v0.2 supplement §1 "LAYERING
  # DISCLOSURE"). Per the v0.2 entity-vs-auxiliary layering invariant, those
  # tables' access lives in `auxiliary_table_access_matrix` below + their
  # v1_0_agent_access amendments in §2a — NOT in this entity matrix.
  #
  # ENTITY-LEVEL vs FIELD-LEVEL ACCESS:
  # The matrix below is ENTITY-LEVEL — declares the maximum disposition an
  # agent may have on any field of that entity. Per-field access (in §1
  # entity_field_additions[*].v1_0_agent_access) NARROWS the entity-level
  # disposition. Example: Scribe.candidate: R+W at entity level; per-field
  # candidate.employment_type grants Scribe: W (because Scribe doesn't read
  # employment_type, just writes it). This is intentional — the entity-level
  # token is the ceiling; field-level may be narrower but never broader.
  #
  # Validation: the validate_entities_data_v0_3 trigger validates FIELD
  # SHAPE only (type checks, enum membership, length caps, array element
  # types). It does NOT enforce which agent is writing — agent-level
  # write permission is DOCUMENTARY in v0.3, enforced at the application
  # layer (cycle.sh + hh_decision_action) where the agent_name in the
  # decision_log row records who wrote. Entity-level RLS enforces TENANT
  # isolation but not agent-level access. Column-level RLS or per-agent
  # database roles would be the v1.1+ enforcement layer; v0.3 is documentary.

# ============================================================================
# §2a — v0.2 entity v1_0_agent_access amendments
# ============================================================================
#
# Per review-schema-change §5: matrix changes must be reflected in entity-level
# v1_0_agent_access lists. v0.3 amends these v0.2 entities:

v0_2_entity_access_amendments:

  voice_corpus:
    v0_2_v1_0_agent_access: [Scribe (R), Concierge (R), voice-drift-canary (R)]
    v0_3_v1_0_agent_access: [Scribe (R), Concierge (R), voice-drift-canary (R), Diagnostic (R), Janitor (R), Cash Conductor (R), Sourcing Scout (R)]
    rationale: |
      All v1.0 agents that produce voice-classified output (Diagnostic for
      §12 conversation opener; Janitor for tacit-note narratives; Cash
      Conductor for chase drafts; Sourcing Scout for per-candidate
      rationale) read voice_corpus for ANN-match exemplars. v0.2 only
      granted Scribe + Concierge; v0.3 extends to all 6.

  tone_rule:
    v0_2_v1_0_agent_access: [Scribe (R), Cash Conductor (R), Concierge (R)]
    v0_3_v1_0_agent_access: [Scribe (R), Cash Conductor (R), Concierge (R), Janitor (R), Diagnostic (R), Sourcing Scout (R)]
    rationale: |
      Janitor agent.md §7 calls hh_load_tone_rules filtered by
      applies_to_agents containing 'janitor' for tacit-note narrative
      voice-classification. Per Round-8 Cat-β finding for Janitor.
      Diagnostic + Sourcing Scout also read tone_rules for their
      voice-classified outputs (§12 opener, per-candidate rationale).

  recent_edit:
    v0_2_v1_0_agent_access: [voice-drift-canary (W), Concierge (R), LoRA (R)]
    v0_3_v1_0_agent_access:
      - voice-drift-canary (W)  # v0.2 unchanged
      - Concierge (R)            # v0.2 unchanged
      - LoRA (R)                 # v0.2 unchanged
      - Janitor (R)              # v0.3 NEW — tacit-note harvest per §4 Step 8
      - Scribe (W)               # v0.3 NEW — writes own edits for retraining
      - Cash Conductor (W)       # v0.3 NEW — writes own chase-draft edits
      - Sourcing Scout (W)       # v0.3 NEW — writes own rationale edits
    rationale: |
      v0.2 only granted W to voice-drift-canary. v0.3 expands W to Scribe,
      Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout (each writes its own recent_edit rows
      for retraining queue). Janitor adds R for tacit-note harvest per
      §4 Step 8. The v0.2 supplement file remains unchanged; this v0.3
      supplement is the authoritative source for the expanded access list.

# ============================================================================
# §3 — Auxiliary Postgres tables (NOT entities) for Cash Conductor
# ============================================================================

auxiliary_tables:

  cash_conductor_transactions:
    rationale: |
      Open Banking transactions are high-volume + time-series + don't model
      as entity.data JSONB. v0.3 introduces a first-class table with
      RLS isolation and indexes for date + match-status. Per Cash Conductor
      §4 Step 3 + ADR-002 vault/Postgres split.
    sql_definition_in: migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §2 (migration is authoritative; this section mirrors the SQL columns)

      currency: {type: string, required: true, default: GBP}
      payee_name_raw: {type: string, required: false, pii: true, retention: Pseudonymized at year 7 per Q4 v0_3_default}

      ingested_at: {type: timestamp, required: true, default: now()}
      raw_payload: {type: object, required: false, pii: true, notes: Full Open Banking response; pseudonymized at year 7}
    indexes:
      - "(tenant_slug, posted_at DESC)"
      - "(tenant_slug, match_status, posted_at DESC) WHERE match_status IN ('unmatched','ambiguous')"
    retention: |
      INTENT (W4-polish enforcement required): 7-year retention with
      pseudonymization at year 7 for PII-bearing fields (payee_name_raw,
      description, raw_payload). Aligned with Q4 v0_3_default. The
      v0.2-to-v0.3 migration creates the table + indexes only; the
      pseudonymization + purge implementation is a W4-polish slice (pg_cron
      job or external scheduled job; not yet authored).
    enforcement_gate: |
      Production use of this table GATED until pseudonymization + purge
      implementation lands as W4 polish. Per-tenant DPA addendum signed
      by founder + tenant before go-live; migration-test tenant exempt.

  cash_conductor_invoices:
    rationale: |
      Open invoice register cached from accounting provider. Same auxiliary-
      table pattern as transactions. Per Cash Conductor §4 Step 4.
    sql_definition_in: migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql §3 (migration is authoritative)
    columns:
      id: {type: integer, required: true}
      tenant_slug: {type: string, required: true}
      invoice_id: {type: string, required: true}
      accounting_provider: {type: string, required: true, enum: [xero, quickbooks, sage]}
      invoice_number: {type: string, required: false}
      issued_at: {type: timestamp, required: true}
      due_at: {type: timestamp, required: true}
      amount_total: {type: number, required: true, notes: NUMERIC(15,2) GBP}

      status: {type: string, required: true, enum: [open, partial, paid, overdue, cancelled, voided], default: open}
      client_contact_id: {type: string, required: false, notes: Links to Bullhorn placement.client_contact_id}
      client_billing_email: {type: string, required: false, pii: true}
      last_chase_position: {type: integer, required: true, default: 0, notes: 0-4 per Cash Conductor §3.2}
      last_chase_sent_at: {type: timestamp, required: false}
      ingested_at: {type: timestamp, required: true, default: now()}
      raw_payload: {type: object, required: false, pii: true}
    indexes:
      - "(tenant_slug, due_at)"
      - "(tenant_slug, status, due_at) WHERE status IN ('open','partial','overdue')"
      - "(tenant_slug, last_chase_position, due_at) WHERE last_chase_position BETWEEN 1 AND 3"
    retention: |
      INTENT (W4-polish enforcement required): 7-year retention with
      pseudonymization at year 7 per Q4 v0_3_default. Cancelled/voided rows
      90d. The v0.2-to-v0.3 migration creates the table + indexes only; the
      pseudonymization + purge implementation is a W4-polish slice
      (pg_cron job or external scheduled job; not yet authored).
    enforcement_gate: |
      Until pseudonymization + 90d-cancelled-purge implementation lands as
      W4 polish, production use of cash_conductor_invoices is GATED by
      explicit per-tenant DPA addendum (same gate as cash_conductor_transactions
      per §3 cash_conductor_transactions.retention). Migration-test tenant
      data is exempt; pilot tenants require the DPA addendum signed before
      go-live.

  # diagnostic_per_claim_sample_rate DEFERRED to future W4-polish ADR
  # (per ADR-006 Tier 2 + §5 deferred_to_future_adr). v0.3 does not
  # declare this config key; the W4 ADR will introduce both the field
  # and its consumer at the same time. Including it in v0.3 without an
  # active consumer would be speculative schema.

# ============================================================================
# §5 — decision_log.payload extension (per ADR-006 Tier 2 prerequisite)
# ============================================================================

decision_log_payload_extension:
  # NOTE: v0.3 does NOT introduce any new decision_log.payload key. The
  # per_claim_confidence_distribution key planned for ADR-006 Tier 2 is
  # explicitly DEFERRED to the future W4-polish ADR + schema supplement
  # that ships alongside Tier 2 activation. v0.3 introducing the payload
  # key without enforcement would violate review-schema-change §3
  # (bounded values require CHECK or trigger). Tier 2 schema work owns
  # the constraint + writer; this v0.3 supplement is silent on it.
  deferred_to_future_adr:
    artefact: ADR (number unassigned) — Diagnostic Tier 2 per-claim quality metric
    schema_owner: future W4-polish supplement (not v0.3)
    rationale: |
      Per ADR-006 Tier 2 disposition: per-claim citation analysis is a
      separate post-launch quality metric outside Gate A. The payload key,
      its [0.0, 1.0] range validation, and the sample-rate config field
      all land together with Tier 2 activation. Tier 2 doesn't activate
      until the voice classifier microservice ships + first pilot tenant
      accumulates ≥30 reports (W4-polish trigger). v0.3 is silent on the
      payload shape to avoid declaring schema without enforcement.

      candidate / contact / brief / placement / opportunity entity_types.
      Re-attaches the trigger to entities table (migration §4).

# ============================================================================
# §8 — Open questions (structured per review-schema-change §8)
# ============================================================================

open_questions:

  Q1_employment_type_enum_completeness:
    question: Are 6 employment_type enum values sufficient for UK recruitment?
    options:
      A: |
        Keep 6 values as in §1.candidate.employment_type — perm, contract,
        contract_inside_ir35, contract_outside_ir35, day_rate, hybrid.
      B: |
        Add 3 more — fixed_term_employee, apprenticeship, contract_for_services.
      C: |
        Per-tenant overrides via tenant_adapters.config.employment_type_extensions
        (array of allowed strings); validate at write time against tenant's list.
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First pilot tenant onboarding; if pilot uses any value
      outside A, escalate to B or C.

  Q2_key_skills_max_length:
    question: Cap at 20 items per candidate adequate?
    options:
      A: Keep cap at 20 (validator hard-fails over).
      B: Increase to 50 (handles senior technical candidates with deep stacks).
      C: Remove cap entirely (rely on application-layer pruning).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot data after 30+ candidates indexed; if >5%
      of candidates hit the 20-item cap, escalate to B.

  Q3_placement_status_enum_lifecycle:
    question: 6-state placement_status enum maps to Bullhorn's native state machine?
    options:
      A: Maintain 6 states; manually map at Janitor dedup time (Bullhorn → IFOS).
      B: Add Bullhorn-native states verbatim to the enum (likely 8-10 more).
      C: Add a mapping table (auxiliary) — placement_status_mapping with
         (bullhorn_state TEXT, ifos_state TEXT, tenant_slug TEXT).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot Bullhorn schema audit at onboarding;
      escalate to B or C if 1:1 mapping breaks.

  Q4_cash_conductor_transactions_retention:
    question: Bank-feed transactions contain PII (payee_name_raw + description).
      What's the production retention policy?
    options:
      A: 7-year retention with automated pseudonymization at year 7 (hash
         payee_name_raw + description; preserve amount + dates for audit).
      B: Indefinite with pseudonymization at year 7 (same as A but matched
         rows retained beyond 7 years for cross-period reconciliation).
      C: Per-tenant retention override in tenant_adapters.config.
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot DPA review (founder + legal); if pilot
      tenant requires shorter retention, escalate to C with tenant-specific
      override. Pseudonymization implementation lands in W4-polish slice.
    production_use_gating: |
      Until pseudonymization implementation lands, production use of
      cash_conductor_transactions table is GATED by an explicit per-tenant
      DPA addendum signed by founder + tenant. Migration-test tenant data
      is not subject to this gate.

  Q5_unknown_config_keys_handling:
    question: validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3 trigger behavior on unknown keys?
    options:
      A: Hard-fail (CURRENT v0.3 behavior per migration §5; Rule 2 Schema-before-code).
      B: Warn-and-store-anyway (permissive; allows forward-compatible additions).
      C: Per-tenant override (tenant-admin can flip behavior for their tenant).
    v0_3_default: A
    trigger_for_revisit: If v1.1 tenant-config experimentation surfaces need
      for forward-compat, escalate to B or C with explicit ADR.

# ============================================================================
# §9 — Why v0.3 is the right unblock
# ============================================================================

rationale: |
  Round-8 categorization (disagreement doc Phase 4 Cat-β) identified that
  4-of-5 remaining agent.md scaffolds (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor,
  Concierge) cannot re-ratify until referenced schema fields exist. v0.3
  adds 14 entity JSONB keys + 2 auxiliary tables + 4 config keys. The
  per_claim_confidence_distribution payload key originally planned for
  v0.3 is DEFERRED to the future W4-polish ADR (per ADR-006 Tier 2 +
  §5 of this supplement); v0.3 is silent on payload schema extensions.

  After v0.3 ratifies + migration applies:
    - Scribe agent.md §3 entity-field table becomes PARTIALLY schema-verifiable:
      the v0.3-added fields (employment_type, key_skills, preferred_channel,
      next_action_target_date, must_haves, nice_to_haves, deal_breakers,
      placement_status, week_1_status_vault_path, satisfaction_signal,
      headcount_growth_signal_text, hiring_velocity_band, decision_window_text)
      are now schema-backed. (Note: week_1_status_note narrative now lives
      in vault per ADR-002; only the vault-path pointer is in Postgres.) The Scribe §3 narrative still references SOME
      fields outside v0.3 scope (current_role_title vs v0.1 current_role;
      seniority — not yet in schema; brief.start_date should be
      start_date_target; opportunity.sector — not yet in schema). These
      residual gaps are tracked in W4-polish-schema-extension backlog;
      they do not block v0.3 ratification but do require a Scribe agent.md
      consistency-pass before Scribe ratifies.
    - Janitor candidate.linkedin_url + recent_edit/tone_rule access valid
    - Cash Conductor agent.md §4 Postgres-tables claim schema-backed
    - Concierge tenant_adapters.config field refs valid
    - Diagnostic Tier 2 schema substrate exists (ADR-006 W4-polish prereq)

  Expected re-ratification: 1 Codex round per agent.md after v0.3 lands;
  ~3-5 residual mechanical findings per agent (down from current 4-6) —
  those are per-agent specifics (workflow, validate.sh/cycle.sh build slices),
  not schema gaps.

   305	  #
   306	  # SCOPE: This matrix is rectangular across `entities:` entity_types ONLY
   307	  # (candidate, contractor, client, contact, brief, opportunity, placement,
   308	  # timesheet — 8 v0.1 entity_types). v0.2 voice_corpus / tone_rule /
   309	  # recent_edit are defined in v0.2 supplement as AUXILIARY POSTGRES TABLES,
   310	  # NOT entities.data entity_types (see v0.2 supplement §1 "LAYERING
   311	  # DISCLOSURE"). Per the v0.2 entity-vs-auxiliary layering invariant, those
   312	  # tables' access lives in `auxiliary_table_access_matrix` below + their
   313	  # v1_0_agent_access amendments in §2a — NOT in this entity matrix.
   314	  #
   315	  # ENTITY-LEVEL vs FIELD-LEVEL ACCESS:
   316	  # The matrix below is ENTITY-LEVEL — declares the maximum disposition an
   317	  # agent may have on any field of that entity. Per-field access (in §1
   318	  # entity_field_additions[*].v1_0_agent_access) NARROWS the entity-level
   319	  # disposition. Example: Scribe.candidate: R+W at entity level; per-field
   320	  # candidate.employment_type grants Scribe: W (because Scribe doesn't read
   321	  # employment_type, just writes it). This is intentional — the entity-level
   322	  # token is the ceiling; field-level may be narrower but never broader.
   323	  #
   324	  # Validation: the validate_entities_data_v0_3 trigger validates FIELD
   325	  # SHAPE only (type checks, enum membership, length caps, array element
   326	  # types). It does NOT enforce which agent is writing — agent-level
   327	  # write permission is DOCUMENTARY in v0.3, enforced at the application
   328	  # layer (cycle.sh + hh_decision_action) where the agent_name in the
   329	  # decision_log row records who wrote. Entity-level RLS enforces TENANT
   330	  # isolation but not agent-level access. Column-level RLS or per-agent
   331	  # database roles would be the v1.1+ enforcement layer; v0.3 is documentary.

   652	
   653	  steps:
   654	    1: |

   662	    4: |

   664	      the v0.2 validate_voice_scores binding while forwarding v0.2 voice-
   665	      score checks. Adds JSONB key validations for 14 v0.3 fields across

   667	      Re-attaches the trigger to entities table (migration §4).
   668	      NOTE: entities table itself is unchanged; entity.data is JSONB and
   669	      v0.3 keys are validated by the trigger, not via ALTER TABLE.

   700	open_questions:
   701	
   702	  Q1_employment_type_enum_completeness:
   703	    question: Are 6 employment_type enum values sufficient for UK recruitment?
   704	    options:
   705	      A: |
   706	        Keep 6 values as in §1.candidate.employment_type — perm, contract,
   707	        contract_inside_ir35, contract_outside_ir35, day_rate, hybrid.
   708	      B: |
   709	        Add 3 more — fixed_term_employee, apprenticeship, contract_for_services.
   710	      C: |
   711	        Per-tenant overrides via tenant_adapters.config.employment_type_extensions
   712	        (array of allowed strings); validate at write time against tenant's list.
   713	    v0_3_default: A
   714	    trigger_for_revisit: First pilot tenant onboarding; if pilot uses any value
   715	      outside A, escalate to B or C.
   716	
   717	  Q2_key_skills_max_length:
   718	    question: Cap at 20 items per candidate adequate?
   719	    options:
   720	      A: Keep cap at 20 (validator hard-fails over).
   721	      B: Increase to 50 (handles senior technical candidates with deep stacks).
   722	      C: Remove cap entirely (rely on application-layer pruning).
   723	    v0_3_default: A
   724	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot data after 30+ candidates indexed; if >5%
   725	      of candidates hit the 20-item cap, escalate to B.
   726	
   727	  Q3_placement_status_enum_lifecycle:
   728	    question: 6-state placement_status enum maps to Bullhorn's native state machine?
   729	    options:
   730	      A: Maintain 6 states; manually map at Janitor dedup time (Bullhorn → IFOS).
   731	      B: Add Bullhorn-native states verbatim to the enum (likely 8-10 more).
   732	      C: Add a mapping table (auxiliary) — placement_status_mapping with
   733	         (bullhorn_state TEXT, ifos_state TEXT, tenant_slug TEXT).
   734	    v0_3_default: A
   735	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot Bullhorn schema audit at onboarding;
   736	      escalate to B or C if 1:1 mapping breaks.
   737	
   738	  Q4_cash_conductor_transactions_retention:
   739	    question: Bank-feed transactions contain PII (payee_name_raw + description).
   740	      What's the production retention policy?
   741	    options:
   742	      A: 7-year retention with automated pseudonymization at year 7 (hash
   743	         payee_name_raw + description; preserve amount + dates for audit).
   744	      B: Indefinite with pseudonymization at year 7 (same as A but matched
   745	         rows retained beyond 7 years for cross-period reconciliation).
   746	      C: Per-tenant retention override in tenant_adapters.config.
   747	    v0_3_default: A
   748	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot DPA review (founder + legal); if pilot
   749	      tenant requires shorter retention, escalate to C with tenant-specific
   750	      override. Pseudonymization implementation lands in W4-polish slice.
   751	    production_use_gating: |
   752	      Until pseudonymization implementation lands, production use of
   753	      cash_conductor_transactions table is GATED by an explicit per-tenant
   754	      DPA addendum signed by founder + tenant. Migration-test tenant data
   755	      is not subject to this gate.
   756	
   757	  Q5_unknown_config_keys_handling:
   758	    question: validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3 trigger behavior on unknown keys?
   759	    options:
   760	      A: Hard-fail (CURRENT v0.3 behavior per migration §5; Rule 2 Schema-before-code).

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:34:#   v0.2 introduces voice_corpus, voice_corpus_chunks, tone_rule, and recent_edit
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:56:  voice_corpus:
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:58:      Per-tenant pack of source documents that define the firm's outbound voice — emails the consultant has written, prior Bullhorn Notes, marketing copy, founder-curated style examples. Read by hh_load_voice_samples (semantic ANN retrieval against the embedded chunks). One voice_corpus per tenant; versioned so re-indexing produces a new row rather than mutating the live pack.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:120:      Versioning matters because (1) tenants may want to roll back if a re-index degrades voice quality (Risk: bad embedding model selection), (2) the LoRA SFT corpus is derived from {voice_corpus, decision_log.agent_drafts} and needs a stable snapshot to train against, (3) audit answers "what voice was the agent grounded against on date X" via voice_corpus.version + agent.payload.policy_version_sha pattern.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:123:  tone_rule:
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:125:      Per-tenant tone constraints expressed as rules. Read by hh_load_tone_rules at session start; constraints are surfaced to the agent as part of the context-assembly bundle (master brief §9). Distinct from voice_corpus: voice_corpus is implicit (semantic similarity); tone_rule is explicit (declarative).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:140:        notes: Stable slug, e.g. "no-i-hope-this-finds-you-well". Referenced by recent_edit when a rule fires.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:157:          Items: agent_name slugs from master brief §8.2 (e.g. ["scribe", "concierge"]). Empty array = applies to all agents. tone_rule rows MUST set this to at least one agent; "all agents" requires the empty-array literal.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:186:      Tone rules are the explicit complement to voice_corpus's implicit grounding. v0.2 ships with ~5-15 rules per tenant (curated at onboarding). v1.1 grows the rule library based on recent_edit patterns (tenant-specific drift becomes a rule).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:189:  recent_edit:

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:259:      recent_edit is the most privacy-sensitive entity in v0.2 because it stores raw agent output (potentially including names, salaries, etc. — anything the agent drafted). RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:267:  voice_samples_embedded:
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:269:      Semantic-search index over voice_corpus text chunks. Read by hh_load_voice_samples to retrieve the top-K most-relevant voice samples for the agent's current task context.

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:405:      Indefinite retention of original_text + edited_text plausibly exceeds GDPR "data minimisation" tests. Is retention of (edit_distance + resolution + tone_rules_triggered) sufficient for v2.0 LoRA SFT pair generation, with the text bodies purged after 90 days?
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:428:    status: This document — Proposed
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:431:      Voice corpus substrate. 3 new entities (voice_corpus, tone_rule, recent_edit) + 1 pgvector HNSW index (voice_samples_embedded over voice_corpus_chunks) + 6 voice_classifier_score / voice_drift_at_close fields on existing entities + 2 relationships.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:443:      Field expansion based on Concierge's real workload findings. Possibly chunk-strategy parameter added to voice_corpus row (semantic-segment-v1 if paragraph chunking underperforms). Tone rule library expansion (initial ~5-15 per tenant → ~30-50 per tenant as edge cases surface).
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:448:      Q11/Q12/Q13 resolved. recent_edit purge policy implemented if Q13=B/C. Brain UI v1.1 surfaces retraining queue. tone_rule examples_positive/examples_negative actively cross-referenced by Gate A.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.v0.2-supplement.yaml:453:      LoRA SFT pair generation from recent_edit + voice_corpus_chunks. Per-firm fine-tuned models. classifier retraining queue feeds production.

I found the companion migration files and am checking whether the supplement’s claimed validation behavior matches the SQL, because mismatches there are load-bearing for schema ratification.

   258	    notes: |
   259	      recent_edit is the most privacy-sensitive entity in v0.2 because it stores raw agent output (potentially including names, salaries, etc. — anything the agent drafted). RLS isolation per tenant_slug is non-negotiable. Retention: indefinite for v1.0 (the SFT corpus needs longitudinal data); revisit at v1.1 if tenant pushes back. Per-message redaction is the operator's responsibility before approval.

 succeeded in 0ms:
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:95:Source: `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 + §6
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:122:- **Trigger:** Voice classifier score below `common-voice.json.voice_classifier_threshold` (default 0.75) after 3 retries per Ultraplan §5.3 retry budget
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:128:- **Severity:** warn — Janitor dedup needs human approval
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:129:- **Trigger:** Dedup confidence `≥ 0.85` per Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 A2 Gate A; human-review-required cases
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:158:- **Trigger:** Upstream API rate-limited; especially LinkedIn (Sourcing Scout multi-source pulls) per master brief §8.1 Change 3 line 592 + bullhorn-integration-path.md §2.2 (Bullhorn 429s)
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:192:Source: derived from operational discipline + sequencing-target §5
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:232:- **Trigger:** Agent entered degraded mode (drafts-only, no auto-send) per Ultraplan §3.5; typically downstream of `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` or similar
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:265:- **Severity:** **blocking** — Concierge cannot send candidate emails; falls back to draft-only
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:273:- **Severity:** **blocking** — Concierge Outlook send disabled; drafts-only
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:360:  - **State-change race (Cash Conductor):** payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window; the invoice is no longer overdue when the orange-tier approval fires; chase cancelled (do NOT send) per Cash Conductor §4 Step 12
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:375:Source: v1.0 agent.md draft specs across Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Cash Conductor, Concierge
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:379:- **Trigger:** Agent's local Gate B metric thresholds missed for the per-agent window (e.g. Janitor dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%; Diagnostic <30% discovery-call conversion rate; etc — see each agent.md §5)
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:395:- **Trigger:** Field extraction (Janitor backfill / Scribe call-summary / Sourcing CV-parse) returned confidence below per-field threshold (default 0.7); writing the field would risk bad data
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:411:  - **Concierge:** lifecycle-event email recipient does not match the candidate_id whose state is changing (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim "no candidates emailed under another's name")
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:414:- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `mismatch_class` (one of `cash_conductor_xero_bullhorn` | `concierge_candidate_email` | future variant), plus class-specific fields: Cash Conductor → `bullhorn_client_id`, `xero_contact_id`, `xero_contact_name`, `bullhorn_client_name`, `invoice_id`, `mismatch_dimension` (e.g. `name`, `email`, `address`); Concierge → `expected_candidate_bullhorn_id`, `actual_recipient_email`, `event_type`
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:433:- **Trigger:** Concierge SLA breached. Three canonical sla_types:
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:436:  - `draft_generation`: lifecycle event → draft generated >30 min (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566; aggregated to Gate B per Concierge §1 disposition rather than per-event hard fail)
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:443:- **Trigger:** Scribe SLA breached (default: call summary rendered within 30 min of call end; Bullhorn note attached within 1h)
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:451:  - **Janitor:** placement record has ambiguous lifecycle markers (e.g. start_date present but no end_date AND no `active` flag AND no recent activity); Janitor cannot safely tag or update
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:452:  - **Concierge:** Bullhorn state transition is outside the 12-event v1.0 taxonomy (acknowledgement / prep / debrief / placement / rejection / withdrawal / on-hold / start-confirm / 7d-checkin / 30d-checkin / 90d-checkin / nurture); handler logs + skips draft
agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md:455:- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `entity_type` (`placement` | `candidate_lifecycle_event`), `entity_id`, `ambiguity_class` (Janitor: e.g. `missing_end_date`, `stale_activity`; Concierge: e.g. `unknown_transition`, `out_of_taxonomy`), plus class-specific fields
agents/_shared/README.md:161:Production rollout (other tenants) waits for Codex ratification of v0.2 + Diagnostic + Janitor verification of the schema against real Bullhorn data (master brief §6 Day 6 Q3 trigger from v0.1).

docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:856:    rationale: v1.0 Concierge addressee-resolution uses primary-decision-maker; panel modelling adds value when v1.1 Triage handles inbound brief queries from multiple stakeholders.
docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml:862:    revisit_trigger: Any Product Spec revision touching R7 nurture cadence (e.g., adding week_2 checkpoint, removing month_24, splitting month_12 into quarterly checkpoints) requires schema migration. Migration steps — (1) ALTER TABLE add new enum value(s) to entities.data JSONB validator; (2) backfill existing placement rows if semantic change (e.g., week_1 → week_1_check_in renaming); (3) Concierge nurture-event firing logic updated to match new cadence.

agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 §5.1: this independence is its strategic value when Bullhorn paths are delayed). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are orange-tier (`xero_reminder_draft_internal` per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` line 104; consultant approval required before send via Concierge); reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).

The tacit-note vault artefact is also mirrored as a Bullhorn `Note` attachment on the resolved entity (consultant-visible in their ATS); the vault copy is the canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split. End-to-end SLA: post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 minutes of webhook receipt per master brief §8.2 line 597.

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:217:Janitor does NOT use:
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:219:- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:220:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:221:- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:222:- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:235:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:124:- **§2.1-B:** master brief §8.1 line 553 says `config.schema.json` extends "`common-*.json`" but doesn't say where the `common-*.json` shared schemas live. Recommended resolution: `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-{client, voice, notifications, vault, ats, accounting, target-patch}.json` per Ultraplan §5.3 line 357-364 enumeration. The renderer resolves `$ref` to these paths during schema materialisation.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:125:- **§2.1-C:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 names `_voice/`, `_playbooks/`, `_decisions/`, `_config.yaml` under `/vault/{tenant}/` but does not enumerate `_secrets.env`. Recommended resolution: add `_secrets.env` to the per-tenant vault skeleton; created at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 line 263 `provision-tenant.sh {slug}` step 2). Mode `0600` owned by `ifos-tenant-{slug}`. Per Master Brief §3.3 "structured data lives in Postgres" applies to entity data; per-tenant *secrets* are the canonical exception that lives on the filesystem.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:133:- **ADR-002 Decision 1** — cortextOS KB stays untouched; IFOS agents don't call `kb-*`. Inheriting `knowledge-base` and `memory` skills would mean IFOS agents have on-disk documentation telling them to invoke commands that, per ADR-002, they must not invoke.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:135:- **Master brief §3.1 (submodule boundary stays intact)** — the §3.1 exception for the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points is already a dead clause per ADR-002. Inheriting cortextOS skills would introduce a new implicit "shadow" — IFOS agents would carry skill documentation that points back into cortextOS's surface — undoing the cleanliness ADR-002 established.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:141:| `knowledge-base` | Calls `kb-query` / `kb-ingest` / `kb-collections` / `kb-setup` against cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB KB | IFOS uses `wiki-*` parallel bus wrappers against `/vault/{tenant}/wiki/` + Postgres `entities` / `entity_links` per ADR-002 Decision 2 and design §2.3 / §2.4 |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:144:| `tasks` | cortextOS task management — `create-task` / `update-task` / `complete-task` against the `orgs/{org}/tasks/` directory | IFOS uses Postgres `decision_log` for the "what did this agent do" trail and the wiki for the "what's the state of this entity" view. The cortextOS task store is unused by IFOS agents (parallel to the KB-untouched decision per ADR-002 Decision 1) |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:145:| `heartbeat` | cortextOS heartbeat cadence — periodic `update-heartbeat` writes to `${ctxRoot}/heartbeats/{name}.json` so the dashboard sees "alive" status | IFOS agents emit heartbeats too (the daemon's fast-checker writes them per `agent-process.ts:597-639` session timer), but the *cadence* and *what the agent does at each heartbeat* is specced per-agent in `agent.md` (Concierge always-on; Janitor cron-driven; etc.). The cortextOS-template `heartbeat/SKILL.md` is a default playbook — IFOS replaces with per-agent specifics |

docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:431:# Telegram (per Concierge's per-agent bot per cortextOS Primitive 5)
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:465:Rationale: matches existing IFOS package convention. Master brief §4.1 line 195-204 enumerates the operative package directories (`packages/{harness, brain, agents-runtime, vertical-adapters, mcp-connectors, context-assembly, decision-log, vault-syncer, voice, onboarding-wizard, dashboard-ext}/`); the renderer is a distinct concern (bundle → runtime translation) that doesn't belong inside any of those. It's not the brain (wiki content, per ADR-002), not the harness (read-only submodule per master brief §3.1), not agents-runtime/_shared/ (the shared helper *content*, not the *tooling* that materialises agents). Standalone `packages/agent-renderer/` keeps the surface clean.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:475:- `packages/brain/agent-cli/` — extending the brain CLI; rejected because the brain CLI is wiki ops (per ADR-002 Decision 2), and bundle rendering is not a wiki concern. Coupling two distinct CLIs into one package raises lock-in cost.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:491:- **Git pre-push hook:** fires too late — the push lands the bundle source in git, but the target tenant filesystem is on a different host (Hetzner UK VPS per Ultraplan §5.1 line 218), so a pre-push hook on a dev laptop has no access to the tenant vault to render against. v1.1+ if a hook integrates with a CI runner that has tenant access.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:538:- **Per-tenant config:** `/vault/<tenant>/_config.yaml` per Ultraplan §5.1 line 220.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:540:- **Schema refs:** `packages/agents-runtime/_shared/common-{client,voice,notifications,vault,ats,accounting,target-patch}.json` per spec gap §2.1-B and Ultraplan §5.3 line 357-364.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:615:`ifos-render-agent render <agent-name> --tenant <slug>` — one render per call. To render Concierge across three tenants, three invocations. Scriptable via bash `for tenant in acme bravo charlie; do ifos-render-agent render concierge --tenant "$tenant"; done`.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:646:**Recovery:** stderr lists missing paths. Founder scaffolds the missing helpers (Week-1 prerequisite per ADR-002). Re-runs.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:666:**Recovery:** stderr: `Tenant <slug> not provisioned. Run: bash scripts/provision-tenant.sh <slug>`. Founder runs `provision-tenant.sh` per Ultraplan §5.5 step 2. Re-runs render.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:718:The cortextOS `cortextos-ifos add-agent` command (`packages/harness/cortextos/src/cli/add-agent.ts:18-316`) is **unchanged**. IFOS does **not** use it for IFOS-owned agents. The R2 commitment per ADR-002 §1.7-A drives this.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:729:6. The agent runs as a **cortextOS-template agent**, NOT as IFOS Concierge. It has `MEMORY.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `knowledge-base` skill, etc. — none of which IFOS expects.

docs/architecture/cortexos-kb-surface-investigation.md:14:Drafting ADR-002 began with the plan to read all four real files and pick one of three outcomes (full shadow / mixed shadow + new wrappers / abandon shadow). After reading **only `kb-setup.sh`**, the substrate of cortextOS's KB became clear, and that substrate is incompatible with the IFOS wiki data model in master brief §5. The ADR's scope is too narrow to absorb that finding — it would be designing the second brain inside an architectural decision record, on the side of an audit.
docs/architecture/cortexos-kb-surface-investigation.md:109:3. **Claude writes `ADR-002` against the design.** The decision is binding; the design is the evidence.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:3:**Status:** Pre-Build-Round-16-Reviewed (Day-19; full bundle built — agent.md + cycle.sh + validate.sh + context.sh + tools.yaml + cleanup.sh + 3 fixtures all present. 16 Codex review-agent-bundle rounds attempted; ADR-006 closed Cat-1/Cat-ζ Gate A architectural finding (R10); subsequent rounds reduced from 5→5→4→5→5→4→5 mechanical findings with steady-state ~5 findings/round at the cross-reference-sync layer. Per master brief §10.3 step 5: founder-arbitrated Accepted on next bilateral pass OR per documented disagreement. Status flips Proposed → Accepted when ALL: (a) bilateral founder review of remaining mechanical findings, AND (b) founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical, AND (c) first production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds, AND (d) Gate B baseline measurement begins.)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 line 595 (row 1; anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`. **Drift flag:** Ultraplan §8.1 A1 (line 489) calls Diagnostic build wave 4-5; master brief line 595 calls it W3-4. Master brief is authoritative per CLAUDE.md (master brief wins on every conflict); W3-4 is the build wave for IFOS.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 line 489.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:8:**Tier:** 2 (request-driven; no persistent PTY) per sequencing-target.md §2.1.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:16:> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A's per-section citation subcheck hard-fails on any section missing its citation, per `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` (Accepted; Day 19 founder-arbitrated). ADR-006 establishes Gate A as per-section hard-fail; per-claim citation analysis is a separate post-launch quality metric outside Gate A (future W4 ADR + schema supplements). The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (target voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`; v0 implementation warns + exits 0 when `IFOS_VOICE_CLASSIFIER_URL` is unreachable per §5 honesty note — W4 polish closes this to unconditional hard-fail) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:33:Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical wall-clock: 10-15 minutes (empirical Day-13 measurement against Hays plc + Charterhouse fixtures); not specified in upstream master brief or Ultraplan.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:64:**Gate A hard-fails** (per ADR-006 + §5 spec):
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:67:- Any section with zero citation links (per-section citation subcheck; ADR-006-canonical)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:114:   → per-section citation hard-fail (ADR-006 Tier 1; no warn-only path)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:146:Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4 + `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` (Accepted; Day 19 founder-arbitrated). Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:148:**Per ADR-006 (canonical interpretation of ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1 line 496 Gate A clause "no claims unsupported by source data"):** Gate A's citation subcheck is per-section hard-fail (every one of the 12 sections has ≥1 evidence link). Per-claim citation analysis is a SEPARATE post-launch quality metric, NOT Gate A — to be authored as a future W4 ADR with schema supplements when the voice-classifier microservice ships + first pilot tenant accumulates ≥30 reports.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:150:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements the per-section citation subcheck as hard-fail today (no warn-only path). It also implements the voice classifier and PII subchecks but **prints warnings to stdout and exits 0** when upstream services are unreachable (voice-classifier URL down, firm-domain whitelist absent) — these warnings are visible in stdout but no separate `decision_log` audit row is written. W4 polish closes these two cases to (a) unconditional hard-fail behaviour AND (b) explicit `validate_check_skipped` audit rows. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the voice + PII gaps. ADR-006 does NOT modify the voice + PII subchecks — only the citation subcheck.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:161:Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `action_type='consultant_feedback'` (registered green-tier action_type per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml`); outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with the registered `consultant_feedback` action_type rather than a new sentinel.
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:182:- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:218:| `validate.sh` Gate A logic (12-section check) | `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` | ✅ Built; per-section subcheck hard-fail per ADR-006; voice + PII subchecks warn-only on upstream-unavailable per §5 honesty note (W4 polish closes) |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:222:| Codex ratification of full agent bundle | Post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill | ⚠ 10 rounds attempted; ADR-006 (Accepted) closed Cat-1 Gate A finding; residual mechanical findings tracked in disagreement doc Phase 4-5 |
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:232:**Build state:** full bundle (cycle.sh, validate.sh, context.sh, tools.yaml, cleanup.sh, 3 fixtures) shipped Day 13-19. Codex review-agent-bundle ratification in progress (10+ rounds; ADR-006 closed the Cat-1/Cat-ζ Gate A finding; iterating on smaller mechanical findings).
agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md:238:| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |

packages/agent-renderer/README.md:118:- **3-5s end-to-end latency (Ultraplan §3.2)** is for the agent runtime pipeline, NOT for the renderer itself. Renderer benchmarks at ~22-25ms per render against the test fixture on Day-8 hardware. Multi-tenant scale testing deferred to Week-5 exercise.
agents/recruitment/concierge/README.md:1:# Concierge — directory README
agents/recruitment/concierge/README.md:44:*End of Concierge README.*
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:1:# Concierge — no candidate ghosted
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Each draft is written to vault at `/vault/<tenant>/concierge-drafts/<draft_id>.md` (canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split); approval routes through the autosend-bridge (Founder Decision D1 path) and on approval the send executes via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; agent-identity email adapter (deferred) deferred to v1.1+). Drafts are yellow-tier `concierge_email_draft` (internal, voice-classified, sample-spot-checked); the customer-facing send is orange-tier (`gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` or `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` depending on channel per autosend-policy.yaml lines 122-149). Gate A hard-fails any draft with voice classifier below the position-specific threshold (≥0.75 standard / ≥0.82 sensitive) OR any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). The 30-minute SLA from lifecycle event to draft is a Gate B leading metric (warning + aggregated; NOT a Gate A hard-fail) per the same ULTRAPLAN line — making it a hard-fail would block legitimate delayed drafts caused by Bullhorn polling fallbacks. Gate B success thresholds: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts + ≥90% 30-min SLA hit (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:25:# Bullhorn placement state-change webhook → Concierge handler
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:251:    → check ghosted-rate metric (any candidate with no Concierge action in
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:277:**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Concierge `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W10-13 build slice. The W10-13 build delivers `agents/recruitment/concierge/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:284:- **Ghosted-rate:** % of candidates with a lifecycle state change in the last 30 days who received no Concierge comm within 14 days of that change. Target <5%.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:293:Concierge uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:315:Concierge has the largest escalation surface of any v1.0 agent — appropriate for the highest-stakes customer-facing comms.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:317:Concierge does NOT use:
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:319:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — reserved for red-tier action attempts per catalogue line 41; Concierge has no red-tier actions. Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:320:- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Concierge's Gate A failures are output-shape or addressee-resolution failures.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:321:- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` (direct firing) — that's fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Concierge fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:337:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` agent**: drift signal. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a draft's voice classifier score is below the position-specific threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Concierge does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Concierge.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:350:Concierge build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:356:| Janitor + Scribe ratified (Bullhorn R+W substrate) | W5-W6 Codex Rounds | ⏸ |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:390:| Q1 | **D1 founder decision (autosend orange-tier path)** — A (bridge to cortextOS), B (Telegram shim), C (no autosend; manual). Concierge ABSOLUTELY needs this resolved before build. | Founder decision per `docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md` §D1. Recommend D1-B (Telegram shim) for v1.0 ship; D1-A as v1.1 upgrade. |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:392:| Q3 | Sending hours per tenant — should Concierge respect tenant's "no sends after 6pm" or "no weekend sends" policies? Per-tenant config? | Per-tenant config in `tenant_adapters.config.concierge_send_window` (default: M-F 09:00-17:00 tenant-timezone). |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:393:| Q4 | Rejection emails (event 6) — Position 3 (voice ≥0.82). Is this enough, or should rejections route to consultant for full draft (not just approve)? | Founder review with first pilot consultant. Recommend: Concierge drafts; consultant approves; never bypasses voice gate. |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:397:| Q8 | agent-identity email adapter (deferred) (v1.1+) — agent-identity sends. Should Concierge use agent-identity email adapter (deferred) for rejection emails (less personal pressure on consultant approving) or always tenant-identity? | v1.0: tenant-identity (Microsoft Graph / Gmail). v1.1+: agent-identity email adapter (deferred) experiment per tenant opt-in. |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:399:| Q10 | 90-day check-in (event 12) — relationship-building tone. Should Concierge also surface "anyone in your network looking?" referral request? | Founder review with first pilot consultant + tenant brand voice. Recommend: opt-in via tenant config. |
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:416:- **Founder Decision D1 RESOLVED** (Q1 above) — without this, Concierge build cannot start
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:428:Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Concierge is the most complex v1.0 agent; its ratification cycles may surface architectural decisions not visible at scaffold stage. Founder review at each iteration is expected.
agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:430:*End of Concierge agent.md draft.*
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:9:Two findings need founder review before the Day 7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 / Ultraplan §12). Both are master-brief drifts against the verified SHA, surfaced in Primitive 3:
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:22:| 1 | Persistent PTY via PM2 | **shipped but flaky** | Cash Conductor (A4), Concierge (A6) |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:23:| 2 | 71-hour context rotation | **shipped and tested** | Concierge (A6) |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:25:| 4 | Approval gates | **shipped and tested** | Cash Conductor (A4), Concierge (A6); standing-auth not in cortextOS — IFOS-layer concept |
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:61:- Master brief §2.4 row 1: used by Triage, Concierge, Pulse, Watchtower, Cash Conductor.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:62:- §8.2 v1.0 build order: **A4 Cash Conductor (Tier 1, weeks 7-8)** and **A6 Concierge (Tier 1, weeks 9-10)** require it.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:63:- §8.1 v1.0 build order: A2 Janitor and A3 Scribe are Tier-2 (cron / webhook) and do NOT depend on primitive 1.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:66:**Risk if flaky:** Tier-1 always-on agents collapse to scheduled cron with cold-start latency, eliminating the "sub-second to first useful action" claim that justifies pricing the Triage/Concierge/Pulse demos above point-tool parity (Ultraplan §3.2). Per Ultraplan §3.1 row 1, the documented contingency is: "Ship the v1.0 agents as scheduled cron with a documented migration path. Loses the Triage closing demo but keeps the build moving." Quirk 2 (`.agents/learnings/00-cortextos-quirks.md`) — `node-pty` requires `npm rebuild` on Node 25+ — is the most likely re-trip wire because the Mac Studio cluster nodes for the v2.0 Sovereign tier may not run Node 22 LTS by default.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:120:- Master brief §2.4 row 2: Concierge (cross-week candidate conversations), Watchtower (per-contractor state), Pulse (multi-source watching).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:121:- v1.0 build: **A6 Concierge** (master brief §8.2, weeks 9-10) holds candidate-lifecycle state across days; loses context-rollover gracefulness if this primitive fails.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:124:**Risk if flaky:** Concierge loses cross-week candidate conversation context at the 71-hour boundary or at API overflow; rejection drafts lose the prior-state nuance that defines Gate A voice quality on the hardest test case (Ultraplan §8.1 A6 gotcha: "Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case — get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship"). Per Ultraplan §3.1 row 2, the documented contingency is: "Manual restart cadence acceptable for v1.0 pilots; flag as known limitation in pilot agreement."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:182:1. **No `chokidar` watcher in the bus.** The bus is poll-based, not push-based. `grep -rn chokidar src/` returns zero hits; `chokidar@^5.0.0` in `package.json:47` is used only by `dashboard/src/lib/watcher.ts:5` for the dashboard UI's file change feed, not for inter-agent message delivery. Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:189:- §8.2 v1.1: A8 **Brief Decoder** is the load-bearing test of the file bus + handoff to Sourcing Scout → Concierge (Ultraplan §3.1 row 3: "This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2"). v1.0 agents don't strictly depend on the bus for inter-agent handoff — but they do depend on it for KB read/write.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:255:- Master brief §2.4 row 4 + §3.4 + Product Spec §6.1 row 4: every agent that auto-sends. Triage, Concierge, Cash Conductor, Competitor Interception, Spec Pitcher, T1 Onboarding Concierge — all depend on the approval gate to graduate from drafts-only.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:256:- v1.0: A4 Cash Conductor (chase email + escalation tier) and A6 Concierge (auto-send acknowledge-new-candidate at Boutique+). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #9, "A consultant complains about auto-send tone within first 2 weeks → Auto-send paused immediately for that tenant" — the approval gate is the kill-switch.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:257:- v1.1: A7 Inbound Triage's auto-send is the most dangerous; per Ultraplan §8.2 A7 gotcha: "Misclassification of a complaint as a routine inbound is a relationship killer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:259:**Risk if flaky:** Every Tier-1 auto-send agent collapses to drafts-only — the documented v1.0 Risk-#1 contingency (Ultraplan §3.5: "Every Tier 1 agent has a 'degraded mode' fallback (drafts-only, no auto-send, scheduled retry) that runs if cortextOS state is unhealthy"). Loses the Triage and Cash Conductor closing demos but does NOT kill v1.0.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:296:Telegram is mature, hardened, and well-tested. iOS is explicitly "coming soon" in the README and has no APNs/push-notification code path — only an `outbound-messages.jsonl` log shape that a future iOS app would consume. Ultraplan §3.1 row 5 already accepts iOS deferral to v1.2, so this is not a v1.0 blocker.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:324:- Master brief §2.4 row 5: every Tier-1 agent's escalation path. Triage, Concierge, Cash Conductor, Pulse, Watchtower, Brief Decoder, Competitor Interception, Night Sourcer, T5, Timesheet Ranger — they all escalate via Telegram and approve via Telegram inline buttons.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:328:**Risk if flaky:** Telegram alone covers v1.0; iOS deferral is already an accepted decision per Ultraplan §3.1 row 5 ("iOS in v1.2 is the marketing line, not a tech blocker"). Real risk is Telegram outage during a Cash Conductor escalation, which is exactly what the activity-channel + per-agent-bot belt-and-braces pattern (primitive 4 evidence, `approval.ts:222-226`) was built to mitigate after the "50h+ Repo-B-style stall" incident.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:370:Full experiment lifecycle code, dedicated sprint-3 test file, fully-documented 8-phase theta-wave skill shipped in the `analyst` template. Approval-gate integration ties it back into primitive 4. Not on the v1.0 critical path — Ultraplan §3.1 row 6 already defers it to v1.1 Night Sourcer.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:389:- v1.0: **No agent depends on this.** Ultraplan §3.1 row 6: "This is for the Night Sourcer in v1.1, not v1.0. Defer the question."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:390:- v1.1: **A11 Night Sourcer** (Ultraplan §8.2, weeks 9-10) is the canonical use case — "8-12 reviewed candidates per brief every morning at 06:30" (Product Spec §2.2 R4).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:393:**Risk if flaky:** Night Sourcer becomes a daytime cron with rate-limit pain — kills the "Walk in to 27 reviewed candidates across your live briefs every morning" pitch (Product Spec §10 line 525). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6: "LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected → defer Night Sourcer to v1.2 if needed" — overnight autoresearch is also the budgeting layer for the LinkedIn rate limit (Ultraplan §8.2 A11 gotcha: "Build the rate-limit budget allocator carefully; this is where £40-60/mo of the £200 per-tenant compute cost lives").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:456:- v1.0: **No agent depends on this.** Ultraplan §3.1 row 7: "This is for v1.1+. Defer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff. Ultraplan §3.1 row 3 already names this as the bus's load-bearing test ("This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:460:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder slips to v1.2 — the documented contingency in Ultraplan §3.1 row 3. Loses the "shortlist in 90 minutes" demo for the Growth tier. The "orchestrator-coupled Telegram polling" trade-off (`agent-manager.ts:465-472`) means if the orchestrator agent itself crashes, the activity-channel callbacks stop until restart — primitive 1's crash-loop alert covers that case.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:3:**Status:** Reference (no Proposed/Accepted lifecycle). Synthesis of `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` §2.6 + `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` Decisions 2-3 + `docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md` §5-A `decision_log.phase` extension.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:6:**Surfaced by:** `ADR-002` §"For Week 1 work" + `second-brain-design.md` Spec gap 2.6 + `sequencing-target.md` §6.5 (Day-4 Postgres provisioning consolidation).
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:20:- **Agent processes** (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per `sequencing-target.md` §2.2-§2.6) — write `wiki/compiled/{candidates,clients,placements,people}/*.md` and `wiki/raw/*/` ingest paths.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:21:- **Wiki library** (`packages/brain/wiki/lib/*.ts` per ADR-002 Decision 2) — the read/write API every agent invokes; serialises and coordinates the above.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:30:Four mechanisms address these four failure modes in §2-§5. **All four mechanisms must be implemented in `wiki/lib/concurrency.ts`** for the wiki API to ship in v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 row 6 (Concierge, the heaviest concurrency stressor).
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:35:- Multi-tenant filesystem isolation — kernel-enforced per Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 (`ifos-tenant-{slug}` OS user); not a concurrency concern within a tenant.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:36:- Cross-tenant read consistency — RLS handles this at the Postgres layer per ADR-002 Decision 3; not a wiki-library concern.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:185:The flock (§2) prevents two operations from racing the same file's read-then-write. The Postgres version check (§3) catches the rare case where flock acquisition succeeded sequentially but a *different* code path (e.g. cron-driven full-table update in Janitor's nightly sweep) updated the row without holding flock.
docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:192:- If second attempt also fails: raise `ESC_VAULT_VERSION_MISMATCH`, record in `decision_log` with `phase='gating_failed'` per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A enum extension, log human-readable error to operator Telegram per primitive 5 escalation surface.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:440:- Hard-delete-per-entity — v1.2+; v1.0/v1.1 hard-delete is only at tenant offboarding (Ultraplan §5.5)
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:442:**The `semantic-search-over-raw` row is the bridge to ADR-002.** Q3 will recommend whether to use cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB for this future operation (which would require shadowing exactly the `bus/kb-ingest.sh` + `bus/kb-query.sh` pair against `raw/` content), or build an IFOS-native pgvector index over raw/ — both are tenable, both are v1.2+ work, neither needs a decision before Week 11.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:450:- **Path:** `/vault/{tenant-slug}/` on the shared encrypted LUKS volume (Ultraplan §5.1 line 218). Sub-paths per §2.1 above.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:451:- **Ownership:** OS user `ifos-tenant-{slug}` in group `ifos-tenants`, mode `0700` on the tenant root, `0644` on files (Ultraplan §5.1 lines 218-223). The PM2 agent process for tenant X runs as `ifos-tenant-{X}` and cannot read tenant Y's vault — kernel enforces this.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:458:  - **Filesystem:** Restic nightly to S3-compatible UK-region storage, 30 days of dailies + 12 months of monthlies (Ultraplan §5.6 line 281). RPO 5 minutes, RTO 4 hours (Ultraplan §5.6 line 283).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:459:  - **Git:** **Spec gap 2.4-A.** Neither master brief nor Ultraplan specifies whether `/vault/{tenant}/` is also a git repo. Obsidian users typically git-init their vaults. **Recommendation:** yes — initialize `/vault/{tenant}/.git/` at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder gets free history, blame, and rollback via Obsidian Git plugin. Agents do NOT commit; the founder commits manually or via a scheduled cron run by Janitor's nightly sweep. **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — git init is one line in `provision-tenant.sh`; commit cadence can be decided in Week 1.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:463:Three tables anchored in Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 ("`tenants`, `entity_graph`, `decision_log`"). The IFOS design here renames `entity_graph` to **`entities`** (one row per entity) and adds **`entity_links`** (the adjacency table) — both flagged below as **Spec gap 2.4-B** because Ultraplan groups them under a single name.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:465:**Table: `tenants`** (master brief §3.3 + Ultraplan §5.1)
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:540:**Table: `decision_log`** (master brief §8.1 Change 2 lines 170-173; Ultraplan §5.1 line 227)

This is the **only** source of entity-history queries — the `_decisions/` directory in Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 is for narrative summaries (Spec gap 2.1-B remains; recommended resolution: `_decisions/` is for founder-written end-of-quarter narratives only, not for agent decisions; agent decisions live exclusively in `decision_log`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:569:**Spec gap 2.4-B:** Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 groups entity index + adjacency under "`entity_graph`". This design splits them into `entities` + `entity_links` for clearer indexing semantics. **Recommended resolution:** adopt the split; update master brief §3.3 or Ultraplan §5.1 to reflect the two-table model. Codex-ratifiable on Day 7 by reading this section.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:575:**v1.0 use:** voice corpus only. Ultraplan §6.1 line 314 says "samples/{n}.md — raw samples indexed for RAG retrieval (embedded with pgvector at capture time)" and line 322 says voice-loader.sh retrieves "the 3 most semantically similar past samples to the current task via pgvector cosine similarity."
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:600:1. **Forward-compatibility with semantic-search-over-raw (v1.2+).** If the eventual Pulse-like agent uses cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB for raw/ content, IFOS-side and cortextOS-side embeddings live in the same vector space and a query embedded once can search both indexes. ADR-002 will recommend keeping this hook open.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:615:**v1.2+ forward-compatibility hook:** the semantic-search-over-raw operation (v1.2+) is the one place where cortextOS's substrate could come back into the picture. ADR-002 will recommend leaving the option open — i.e. don't dismantle cortextOS's KB tooling — without scoping the v1.2 work now.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:672:| `search-by-name` | Postgres `entities` trigram on `display_name` (`gin_trgm_ops`) | Filesystem grep over `wiki/compiled/{type}/*.md` frontmatter | Hot path; sub-second target. Fuzzy match returns top-N by similarity score; tie-break by `importance_score DESC` then `updated_at DESC`. Fallback only fires if Postgres unhealthy (per master brief §3.5 RLS / Ultraplan §3.5 degraded-mode contingency). |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:680:| `semantic-search-over-raw` | **v1.2+ deferred** — placeholder primary = either cortextOS mmrag/ChromaDB **OR** IFOS-native pgvector over chunked raw/ content | n/a | ADR-002 will recommend keeping cortextOS's substrate available as the v1.2+ implementation option without committing to it now. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:688:**No operation reads via grep at hot path.** All hot-path reads go through Postgres. Filesystem reads are the source-of-truth fallback for the rare unhealthy-Postgres case (which itself triggers the degraded-mode fallback per Ultraplan §3.5).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:708:- t=0: Concierge calls `append-to-narrative(candidate_sarah_bowen, "Sent follow-up email")`. Acquires `sarah_bowen.md.lock`. Reads file. Reads `updated_at = T0` from Postgres.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:709:- t=0+50ms: Janitor calls `update-entity(candidate_sarah_bowen, "right_to_work_status", "verified")`. Blocks on the flock.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:710:- t=0+300ms: Concierge releases flock after writing the narrative line and updating Postgres (`updated_at = T1`). The atomic file rename completes.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:711:- t=0+301ms: Janitor acquires flock. Reads file (now contains Concierge's append). Reads Postgres (`updated_at = T1`). Computes new frontmatter. Writes file atomically. Postgres UPDATE `WHERE updated_at = T1` succeeds (`updated_at = T2`).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:751:v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic (no vault writes; sales-only), Janitor (heavy writes — nightly batch of thousands of Bullhorn entity updates), Scribe (per-call writes; ~30-60 min/day per consultant per Product Spec §2.2 R6), Cash Conductor (writes Placement updates on invoice events; reads heavily for invoice context), Sourcing Scout (read-heavy; produces drafts that the agent itself writes elsewhere), Concierge (per-lifecycle-event writes; reads candidate state on every inbound).
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:755:- `search-by-name` — Concierge inbound message processing; the customer-facing latency claim ("60-second response" per Product Spec §2.2 R1) depends on this returning in <100ms.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:757:- `append-to-narrative` — Concierge / Scribe logging; tolerates few-hundred-ms.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:761:- `ingest-entity` — Janitor's nightly sweep ingests thousands of records; batching is the model. Per-record latency 100ms-1s is fine.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:771:| Concierge | 20:1 | reads candidate state on every lifecycle event; writes only on event transitions |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:772:| Scribe | 3:1 | reads candidate for context on every call; writes structured fields + tacit notes |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:775:| Janitor | 1:5 | reads each Bullhorn entity once; writes many cleanup updates per sweep |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:778:**Peak concurrent agents per tenant (v1.0):** 4-5 — Janitor (nightly batch but daytime cleanup tasks too), Scribe (webhook-driven per-call), Cash Conductor (always-on watcher), Sourcing Scout (request-response), Concierge (always-on). At Boutique-tier these all run in one PM2 process group per tenant; at Scale-tier the same.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:780:**Peak concurrent tenants on shared infra (v1.0):** 3-6 (Product Spec §3 first three paid pilots target). The shared Postgres + RLS model (Ultraplan §5.1 line 226) handles this trivially.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:782:**Decision-log volume:** every agent run produces 1-3 `decision_log` rows (`hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, optionally `hh_decision_action` when human responds). At 6 v1.0 agents × ~10 runs/agent/day × 3 tenants × 3 rows = ~540 rows/day per shared Postgres instance. Trivial volume; the table needs hash partitioning (per Ultraplan §5.1) primarily for query performance at v1.2+ scale, not v1.0 write throughput.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:890:| **Multi-tenancy enforcement** — how `tenant_slug` is validated at the entry point (master brief §3.5) | Wrapper reads `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` env var (set by PM2 ecosystem per-tenant process group); CLI handler validates that the arg `--tenant` matches the env or fails with `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK`. Kernel-enforced isolation underneath (POSIX 0700 per Ultraplan §5.1) means a wrong tenant fails at filesystem read. | Server receives `CTX_TENANT_SLUG` at connection setup via MCP server args; rejects any tool call whose `tenant_slug` mismatches the connection identity. Filesystem isolation underneath same as α. One enforcement site. | Library validates `tenant_slug` against env var. Same enforcement model as α, but agent-side discipline depends on skill docs being followed. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:891:| **Operational complexity** — new infrastructure introduced | None new. 12 shell wrappers + a Node CLI binary + a library; same shape as `packages/harness/cortextos/bus/`. No new PM2 process. | One new PM2 process per machine (`ifos-wiki-mcp`). Adds to the operations surface: process supervision, restart policy, port allocation, logs to manage. At Sovereign tier (one cluster slice per tenant per Ultraplan §5.4) this is one extra process per tenant. | Skill files added to every agent at scaffold time. Under R2 renderer (recommended), the renderer must be extended to inject the wiki skill — additional renderer logic. Under R1, automatic. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:895:| **Failure mode if cortextOS daemon is unhealthy** | Wrappers don't depend on the daemon — they exec directly into Node. As long as Postgres is up and the filesystem is mounted, wiki ops succeed. Decision_log writes still go through (Postgres direct). Tracks per Ultraplan §3.5 "Tier 1 agents have degraded-mode fallbacks" — the wiki is part of the fallback substrate, not part of what fails. | If `ifos-wiki-mcp` crashes, every agent loses wiki access until it restarts. PM2 auto-restart bounds the outage to ~5s, but during the outage every wiki call fails. If `cortextos-daemon` is unhealthy, MCP connections from agents (which are in PTYs supervised by the daemon) may also be affected. Two-process dependency. | Same as α (library invoked directly, no daemon dependency) but adds skill-discovery path: if the agent's Claude Code session can't find the skill (e.g. corrupted scaffold), all wiki ops fail. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:908:3. **Master brief §3.5 + §5.5 (multi-tenancy + onboarding wizard 5-day flow).** §3.5's "100 customers by end of 2027" stress test (Product Spec §5.4) demands zero per-customer operational drag. Option α adds no per-customer infrastructure. Option β at Sovereign tier (Ultraplan §5.4 per-tenant cluster slice) means one `ifos-wiki-mcp` process per Sovereign tenant — a new operational surface to monitor at scale.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:913:- **Persistent server state.** Option β's long-running process could cache hot reads, hold prepared statements, maintain pgvector connection pools. Option α pays a fresh Node startup per call (~80-200ms). For v1.0 expected volume (Concierge ~10 lifecycle events/day per tenant × 3 tenants × 5 wiki reads each = 150 calls/day per machine), the cumulative startup cost is ~30 seconds/day. Acceptable. **If hot-path latency becomes a constraint at v1.2+**, we can introduce a persistent CLI daemon (`wiki-cli --daemon`) that pre-warms — a future optimisation without changing the agent surface.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:922:- **v1.2+ semantic-search-over-raw:** ADR-002 will recommend keeping this hook open. Under Option α, the eventual implementation is a `wiki-semantic-search.sh` that internally chooses either cortextOS's mmrag (the v1.2+ option) or an IFOS-native pgvector-over-raw index — no agent-side change.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:944:- **Week 13:** wiki-aware agent integration — Concierge (v1.0 A6, master brief §8.2) is the first user; voice-loader.sh from §2.4.3 reads `voice_samples_embedded` via the new library; first end-to-end Concierge run hits the wiki for `search-by-name` and `update-entity`. Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view from master brief §6 Day 3) is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:967:| **2.1-A** | Master brief §5.1 lines 297-349 vs Ultraplan §5.1 line 220 disagree on vault layout | Two vault structures specified in different docs | Adopt the merged tree in §2.1 of this design: `/vault/{slug}/` top-level (`_voice/ _playbooks/ _decisions/ _config.yaml wiki/ temp/`) with the master brief's `wiki/{raw,compiled,.wiki}/` subtree underneath. Codex ratifies on Day 7 by reading §2.1. | No |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:968:| **2.1-B** | `_decisions/` directory (Ultraplan §5.1) overlapping with Postgres `decision_log` table | Two candidates for "where agent history lives" | Resolved in §2.4.2: `_decisions/` is for founder-written end-of-quarter narratives only; agent decisions live exclusively in Postgres `decision_log`. Update Ultraplan §5.1 wording. | No |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:969:| **2.1-C** | `wiki/compiled/playbooks/` (master brief §5.1 line 331) collides with `/vault/{tenant}/_playbooks/` (Ultraplan §5.1) | Same folder name at two paths with different intended uses | **Recommendation:** drop `wiki/compiled/playbooks/`. Playbooks live at `/vault/{tenant}/_playbooks/` only. Update master brief §5.1 to remove the `playbooks/` line from the `wiki/compiled/` tree. | No |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:972:| **2.4-A** | Master brief / Ultraplan silent on git for tenant vault | No backup-via-git mechanism specified | `git init` at tenant provisioning (`provision-tenant.sh` Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder commits via Obsidian Git plugin; agents don't commit. | No — commit cadence can be decided Week 1+. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:973:| **2.4-B** | Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 groups entity index + adjacency under "`entity_graph`" | Single-table model insufficient for the JSONB GIN + trigram + adjacency mix v1.0 needs | Split into `entities` + `entity_links` per §2.4.2. Update master brief §3.3 / Ultraplan §5.1 wording. **Roll into Week 0 Day 4 Postgres provisioning.** | **Tight** — Day 4 of Week 0 (this week). |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:974:| **2.4-C** | Master brief / Ultraplan silent on embedding model | No model specified for voice_samples_embedded or future compiled/ embeddings | Adopt `gemini-embedding-001` (3072 dims) — matches cortextOS's KB substrate per kb-setup.sh migration target. Same `GEMINI_API_KEY` serves both. Revisit if a sharply better model ships before Week 11. | No |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:976:| **3.4-A** | Master brief §5.5 (lines 416-420) v1.0 brain wording | Says "shadow four files" — incorrect per Q1.5 | Rewrite per §3.4 of this design: "9 `wiki-*.sh` parallel wrappers + Postgres entities/entity_links/decision_log + pgvector voice." Bundles with ADR-002 atomic correction commit. | No — wording change, not work change. |
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:979:**Five gaps are already resolved inline in this design** (2.1-B, 2.1-C, 2.2-A, 2.2-B, 2.6 with mechanisms in §2.6.x). **Three need master-brief / Ultraplan edits in the atomic correction commit** (2.1-A wording reconciliation, 2.4-B / 3.4-B Postgres table-rename, 3.4-A v1.0 brain wording rewrite). **Two are Week-1 prerequisite artefacts** (§1.7-A renderer ADR-003 + `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`; 2.6 companion `vault-concurrency.md`). **Two are operational defaults** that the founder can either ratify or override at any later point (2.4-A git init at provisioning; 2.4-C `gemini-embedding-001` model choice).
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:5:**Purpose:** Drop-in email drafts the founder sends to Bullhorn partnerships + developer support to resolve Sub-decisions A + B in `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`. Closes Risk #2 mitigation path; unblocks Janitor W5 build gate.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:13:Per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3:
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:17:**These don't block today.** They block **Janitor W5 build** (per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3). You have ~5 weeks of runway. But send today/Monday because Bullhorn's response time is 2-5 business days, and we want the answers before Diagnostic W3-4 completes so Janitor W5 starts unblocked.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:44:> I'm Maddox Rigby, founder of Intel Force Ltd (UK). We're building Intel Force OS — an AI agent fleet for UK recruitment agencies that integrates with Bullhorn as the primary ATS. Three of our six v1.0 agents (Janitor for nightly data cleanup, Scribe for post-call structured write-back, Concierge for lifecycle event triggers) will read and write to Bullhorn on behalf of pilot tenants.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:73:- If they confirm direct-tier works for pilot scale → Sub-decision A flips to **Direct API**; Status: Accepted. Update `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §5.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:74:- If they require marketplace membership before production access → Sub-decision A is **Marketplace**; need cost + timeline to assess against kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (Janitor W5 deadline).
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:132:- Update `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6 (refresh-loop architecture) with the confirmed numbers.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:142:3. Claude will update `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §5 (Sub-decision A) or §6 (Sub-decision B) Status from Proposed → Accepted (or document any new findings).
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:151:2. **Monday 2026-06-01** — second nudge with explicit deadline reference ("we're targeting Janitor build W5; need clarity by then")
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:154:**Hard cutoff:** if no response by 2026-06-10 (3.5 weeks from today), Sub-decision A is forced to **Direct API** (lowest-friction path; commercial verification deferred to post-pilot) and the connector scaffolds against that — per the §2.3 §1.4 fallback architecture in `bullhorn-integration-path.md` which was designed for exactly this scenario.
docs/operations/bullhorn-outreach-emails.md:160:**Reference.** Two drop-in email drafts ready for founder to send. Expected wall-clock: 1 week for both responses. Outcome: Sub-decisions A + B flip Accepted; Risk #2 mitigated; Janitor W5 build unblocked.

docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:56:**Rule 2 (Schema before code) satisfied:** the schema work for the per-claim quality metric (payload key + per-tenant config field) lands in the future W4 ADR's supplements before any code reads/writes those fields. This ADR-006 does NOT introduce schema fields; it only specifies Gate A as per-section hard-fail.
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:58:**Rule 4 (Quality gates before features) satisfied for the per-section citation subcheck:** it is hard-fail at v0 with no warn-only paths. (Other Gate A subchecks — voice classifier + PII — retain v0 warn-only paths when upstream services are unreachable per Context note; W4-polish closes those. ADR-006 addresses only the per-section subcheck.) Per-claim quality is a separate signal, not a weakening of Gate A's per-section subcheck.
docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:70:> **Gate A (per ADR-006):** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link — per-section citation subcheck is hard-fail (no warn-only paths). The ULTRAPLAN clause "no claims unsupported by source data" is interpreted at Gate A as "every section has at least one evidence link"; per-claim citation analysis is a SEPARATE post-launch quality metric outside Gate A (a W4 ADR to be authored at first-pilot polish time).

docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md:76:This is the explicit in-band amendment Codex `review-architecture-decision` ratification path requires — reviewers consulting ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1 see the pointer to ADR-006 directly in the source line. The amendment landed alongside the ADR-006 R2 fix commit, not in a future commit.

docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:20:**Real issue:** 10 action_types (including the canonical orange `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` — Concierge's primary outbound action) are classified as orange. v1.0 ships green+red only. In v1.0, those orange action_types must either:
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:22:- **D1-A: Become red in v1.0** — refuse all orange action_types entirely. Concierge can't send customer-visible Bullhorn Notes at all in v1.0. Diagnostic can't send outbound emails. Cash Conductor can't send payment reminders. **Reduces Concierge to draft-only voice-classified output that the consultant manually copies.** Concierge's pitch becomes "drafts that pass voice gate" instead of "auto-send with approval gate".
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:23:- **D1-B: Implement orange approval gate in v1.0** — adds ~1 week to Concierge build (W10-13 → W10-14) to wire `autosend_await_approval` through cortextOS primitive 4 + Telegram bot. Concierge's pitch is whole.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:26:**Claude's recommendation (initial briefing, Day 8):** D1-C. v1.0 ships with orange-as-red default + documented manual approval path. Concierge demo pitch becomes "voice-classified drafts that the operator can approve in Telegram"; doesn't promise full auto-send-with-policy in v1.0. v1.1 implements full orange approval gate.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:30:**Recommended timing:** Week 9 (default; sequential with master brief §8.2). Pre-builds the bridge before Concierge W10-13 starts. Allows: Day 1-2 = bridge code + tests; Day 3 = live integration test on migration-test tenant; Day 4 (Concierge W10 start) = Concierge uses bridge from day 1. No timeline pressure on Diagnostic W3-4 or Janitor W5 (neither use orange tier action_types).
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:32:**Alternative timing:** Insert as next IFOS Claude slice now (post-Diagnostic-build, ~Week 8). Marginal benefit: D1 becomes a closed item earlier; bridge gets stress-tested before Concierge needs it. Cost: 2-3 days inserted before Concierge.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:34:**Cost of deferral:** Concierge W10 build risks slipping if bridge isn't ready. Concrete delay: ~3 days. Risk #2 (Bullhorn) is the bigger blocker for Concierge (auth path); D1 is downstream of that.
docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:142:| **D1** (autosend v1.0 tier) | This week | Concierge build scope (W10-13) |

docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md:167:OR open a follow-on ADR if the decision warrants more substantive recording (e.g., ADR-005 for D1; ADR-006 for D2 + D3 bundle).
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:5:**Surfaced by:** `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` §"For Week 1 work" + `docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` (full design)
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:13:ADR-002 §1.7-A surfaced the spec gap. Master brief §8 (lines 545-568) specifies the IFOS Agent Bundle v2 — six files plus three fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/` — but is silent on how the bundle becomes a runnable cortextOS agent. The cortextOS daemon's `AgentManager.discoverAndStart()` (`packages/harness/cortextos/src/daemon/agent-manager.ts:906-941` `discoverAgents()`) reads from `${frameworkRoot}/orgs/<org>/agents/<name>/` with a cortextOS-shaped layout (`config.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env`). The two layouts are incompatible without translation.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:15:The §1.7 inheritance investigation in `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` found that `cortextos-ifos add-agent` copies the full `templates/agent/.claude/skills/` tree verbatim per `src/cli/add-agent.ts:88-110, 382-402` — 24 cortextOS template skills including `knowledge-base` (calls `kb-*` against cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB KB, which IFOS agents must not invoke per ADR-002) and `memory` (heartbeat-ingests `MEMORY.md` into the KB, which IFOS agents don't have because they use Postgres `decision_log` per master brief §8.1 Change 2). ADR-002 recommended R2 (bundle-only; no skill inheritance) but deferred the binding decision to this ADR.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:17:The design document (`docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md`) specified the renderer across five sections: source vs target layout (§1), the 12-row file mapping + R2 commitment + Concierge worked example (§2), six concrete mechanism decisions including TypeScript Node at `packages/agent-renderer/` (§3.1), manual developer invocation (§3.2), Option γ for `_shared/` origination (§3.3.3), and overwrite-no-merge re-render policy (§3.4), seven failure modes with exit codes (§4), and integration with the broader build (§5). 22 spec gaps surfaced and bucketed. This ADR ratifies the design's recommendations.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:54:The Concierge worked example in design §2.3 demonstrates end-to-end render: source bundle layout, CLAUDE.md preamble draft (resolves spec gap §2.1-A), materialised `config.json`, synthesised `.env`, hook files verbatim, `_shared/` symlink resolution.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:70:Three edits per design §5.3. Edits A and B land in this ADR's commit (small wording adds; Edit A is needed live before Week-1 renderer implementation). Edit C joins the deferred atomic correction commit alongside ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:139:Joins the deferred atomic correction commit (parallel to ADR-002 Edit 1 + Edit 2). Codex ratifies the combined commit on Day 7 per master brief §10.6.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:145:**For Week 0 remaining (Day 2 through Day 7).** ADR-003 doesn't unblock or block any remaining Week 0 work directly. Day 2 (Bullhorn integration path), Day 3 (sequencing + Brain UI scope), Day 4 (Postgres provisioning with `entities` + `entity_links` split per ADR-002 Edit 3 + `_secrets.env` skeleton), Day 5 (auto-send safety policy + kill criterion), Day 6 (vertical schema v0.1), Day 7 (single-sentence test + first Codex ratification) all proceed independently. The renderer is queued for Codex Day-7 review but does not gate Day 7's other reviews.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:149:**For Codex Day-7 ratification queue.** ADR-003 + the design doc join the queue alongside `cortextos-primitive-status.md`, ADR-001, ADR-002, `second-brain-design.md`, the deferred atomic master-brief correction commit, and the Day-4 Postgres provisioning artefact. The 22-item spec gap consolidation in design §5.4 plus the four-bucket structure (resolved inline / master-brief edits / Week-1+ prerequisites / operational defaults) is the ratification-supporting evidence.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:151:**For the master brief atomic correction commit.** Edit C (the §8 footnote) joins ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits in the deferred single commit at end of Week 0 / early Week 1. Edits A and B land in this batch's commit because (a) Edit A is needed live before Week-1 renderer implementation can scaffold the package path, (b) Edit B is a small wording add to a code block, (c) neither is substantive enough to warrant the atomic-correction overhead.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:156:- **`_shared/` helper code authoring** (`voice-loader.sh`, `hook-helpers.sh` contents) — already on the Week-1 prerequisite list per ADR-002 §"For Week 1 work." Not an ADR; just implementation work.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:157:- **`docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md` companion document** — already on the Week-1 prerequisite list per ADR-002. Not an ADR; resolves design §2.6 spec gap.
docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md:164:2. Edit C (§8 footnote) joins ADR-001 + ADR-002 edits in the deferred atomic correction commit at end of Week 0 / early Week 1.

docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:63:- **Postgres tables (v1.0):** `tenants`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log` — schemas in design §2.4.2. RLS by tenant_slug on every table except `tenants`. The Ultraplan §5.1 line 227 single `entity_graph` table is **split** into `entities` (one row per entity) and `entity_links` (adjacency) — see Spec gap 2.4-B in the design doc.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:69:The one operation where cortextOS's mmrag/ChromaDB substrate could still serve IFOS is **semantic-search-over-raw** against `/vault/{tenant}/wiki/raw/` content (per design §2.3 row 9). That operation is **v1.2+ deferred**. ADR-002 explicitly **does not commit** to either cortextOS-substrate or IFOS-pgvector-native for the eventual implementation. The decision is deferred to a future ADR (likely in v1.2 planning) so it can be made against then-current evidence: actual raw/ volume, actual query patterns, actual cost data on Gemini embeddings, and whether Anthropic or OpenAI has shipped a sharply better embedding model by then.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:105:This edit lands on **Day 4 of Week 0 (this week)** as part of the Postgres provisioning task per master brief §6 Day 4, **not** in the brain-ADR atomic commit. ADR-002 authorises the split; Day 4 implements it.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:111:**For Week 1 work.** ADR-002 makes three Week-1 prerequisites load-bearing:
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:117:**For Day 4 this week (Postgres provisioning).** The `entity_graph` → `entities` + `entity_links` split per Spec gap 2.4-B / 3.4-B must land in the Day 4 migration. This is the only immediate-week impact of ADR-002.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:121:**For the master brief atomic correction commit.** ADR-001 (Edit: `chokidar watcher` → `FastChecker poll loop` in §2.4 row 3 + §3.2 latency reframe in Ultraplan) and ADR-002 (Edits 1, 2, 3 above — §3.4 wording, §5.5 v1.0 brain build wording, §6 Day 4 Postgres table list) **all landed together in commit `0e5b2b4` on 2026-05-20** ("docs: master brief reconciliation — 11 edits batch-applied"). Ratified by Codex on Day 7 along with ADR-001 + ADR-003 per master brief §10.6.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:123:**For future ADRs.** ADR-002 explicitly defers three decisions:
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:133:1. ADR-001 + ADR-002 master-brief edits LANDED in atomic-correction commit `0e5b2b4` (Day 7 2026-05-20). Status: closed.
docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md:135:3. Day 7 Codex ratification reviews ADR-001 + ADR-002 + the seven Week 0 artefacts together (per master brief §10.6).
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:4:**Date:** 2026-05-22 (Day 11, pre-Concierge W10 prerequisite)
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:7:**Prerequisite for:** Concierge build (W10-13 per master brief §8.2)
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:14:Autosend-safety-policy §3 declares 10 v1.0 action_types as **orange tier** — most importantly the canonical orange `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` (Concierge's primary outbound action). Orange-tier actions require per-action human approval via Telegram before executing.
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:154:🔔 Approval request: Concierge bullhorn_note_customer_visible
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:254:**Recommended:** Week 9 of master brief sequence (W9 = `2026-07-14` if Week 1 starts `2026-05-21`). Buffers 2-3 days before Concierge W10-13 starts. Allows:
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:257:- Day 4 (Concierge W10 start): Concierge uses bridge from day 1
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:259:**Alternative:** as the next IFOS Claude slice (now). Pre-builds the prerequisite before Diagnostic W3-4 starts, so it's not blocking Concierge. ~2-3 days inserted before Diagnostic.
docs/decisions/autosend-approval-bridge-spec.md:308:- Unblocks Concierge build (W10-13) — without this, Concierge can only ship as drafts-only (D1-A) which loses the demo value prop
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:24:Operational consequence: end-to-end latency of an N-hop agent pipeline is **bounded below by N × `pollInterval`**. At the default 1000ms with the 4-agent Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (3 hops), the floor is ≥3 seconds. The current master brief §3.2 / Ultraplan §3.2 narrative ("four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes") is technically consistent with this floor at 1000ms — but only just, and a customer-facing claim of "sub-second handoff" would be wrong.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:46:| **A. Accept the floor** | Leave `pollInterval` at the 1000ms default. Rewrite Ultraplan §3.2's "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" to "four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end" and remove any "sub-second handoff" framing from the closing-demo deck | Zero engineering | Honest signal; Concierge's "30-min lifecycle event → drafted comms" SLA is unaffected (3-5s is rounding error against 30 minutes); Brief Decoder's "90-min brief-to-shortlist" is also unaffected. Only sales narrative changes. |
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:52:2. The user-visible SLAs (Concierge 30-min lifecycle event, Brief Decoder 90-min shortlist, Triage 60-second response) all have ≥30× headroom against a 3-5 second pipeline floor. The pipeline-latency claim is sales narrative, not product SLA.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:59:- Single edit to Ultraplan §3.2: rewrite "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds, not the 15-second cold-start tax Lambda imposes" → "four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound."
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:72:- The brain-replacement seam (§3.4) is unaffected by this ADR. ADR-002 covers that separately.
docs/decisions/ADR-001-bus-dispatcher-poll-not-chokidar.md:76:**Accepted — Option A.** Founder decision logged 2026-05-16. The master brief §2.4 row 3 + Ultraplan §3.2 edits are deferred to a single atomic "spec drift reconciliation" commit that lands alongside whatever ADR-002 dictates for §3.4.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:6:**Surfaced by:** Master brief §6 Day 3 (lines 469-473) — "Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's 'close first 3 pilots fastest' → `.agents/decisions/sequencing-target.md`" (note: master brief §6 names `.agents/decisions/`; this document lives at `docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md` matching the convention established by ADR-001 through ADR-003 + bullhorn-integration-path.md — **Spec gap §1-A** flagged for atomic correction).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §8.2 (the build-order table) + Ultraplan §9 (the existing 14-week sprint plan) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + §6 for the Bullhorn-dependency carry-forward; then `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` §5.2 for the renderer's Week-1-prerequisite role.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:22:| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:23:| A3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:26:| A6 | Concierge | 10-13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:32:- **A. First agent.** Which agent ships first in Week 3-4? Anchors the renderer (ADR-003) + `_shared/` helpers (Week-1-2 prereqs from ADR-002) + Postgres `decision_log` (Day 4 Week 0) end-to-end test. Affects how risk surfaces — first agent is the smoke test for every substrate dependency.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:34:- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:42:**Weeks 5-13 planning is speculative without §B.** Each agent's prerequisites (Bullhorn MCP, Fathom/Fireflies, Xero, LinkedIn) have lead times. Bullhorn MCP work itself starts Week 1 per Ultraplan §9 line 724 ("Bullhorn MCP server is the critical path; week 1 starts on it"). Without knowing the agent build order, those infrastructure prereqs can't be sequenced.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:44:**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:46:The Day-7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 Day 7 / Ultraplan §12) doesn't directly test sequencing — but Q4 ("Have we scoped the Agent Bundle v2 refactor and is the work <5 days?") and the Week-0 deliverable list at Ultraplan §9 line 737-741 both assume a sequenced plan exists. The Day 7 review surfaces this document for Codex ratification.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:50:Six criteria to evaluate each agent against in §2. Each criterion scored High / Medium / Low or with a concrete number; substantive cells in §2 must justify the score by reference to master brief / Ultraplan / Product Spec / Day-2 Bullhorn decision.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:57:| 4 | **Commercial value** | Whether the agent's output is demoable to a design partner / first paying customer per Product Spec §2.2 R-rows | Earlier commercial-value agents accelerate the first-pilot conversion (Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12); but commercial-value agents are typically the more complex ones, conflicting with criterion 1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:65:Per master brief §12 / Ultraplan §10 row #2 (the four-risks-that-kill-v1.0 table), the **documented v1.0 scope-cut contingency** is verbatim:
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:90:Six agents, six tables. Anchored to master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §8.1 lines 487-690 + Product Spec §2.2 R-rows + `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risks #1, #2, #5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:96:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:97:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises renderer (ADR-003) end-to-end, `_shared/voice-loader.sh` (audit narrative tone in founder's voice per Ultraplan §8.1 line 495), `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` (decision_log writes), Postgres `decision_log` per ADR-002. Does NOT exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop (Day 2 §4.5), wiki API (v1.0 weeks 11-13 per `second-brain-design.md` §3.4), or cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 (Tier 2 means no PTY persistence) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:99:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Internal sales tool per Product Spec §2.2 R13 ("Not on the customer pricing card"). Drives qualified discovery-call pipeline. Demoable to a prospect but not the closing demo. Ultraplan §8.1 line 499 Gate B target: "≥30% of diagnostics produced lead to a discovery call booked" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:103:**Readiness summary:** Diagnostic — simplest implementation (~1 week per Ultraplan §8.1), exercises renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log end-to-end without Bullhorn or wiki, no cross-agent dependencies, ready by end of Week 4 per master brief §8.2 line 601 + Ultraplan §9 line 753.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:105:### 2.2 — A2 Janitor
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:109:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 513 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — the Bullhorn MCP work is rate-limiting per Ultraplan §8.1 line 514 ("Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build"). One MCP server (Bullhorn) + Companies House for enrichment. Single primary output (cleanup report) but with continuous nightly cron pattern |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:110:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First agent to exercise Bullhorn auth refresh-loop** per `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5. First user of `_secrets.env` per Day 2 §4.3 (per-tenant Bullhorn OAuth tokens). First cron-driven agent writing to Postgres `decision_log`. Exercises dedup-confidence threshold (Ultraplan §8.1 line 511 Gate A: ≥0.85) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:111:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #2** (Bullhorn auth path per RISK-REGISTER). Closes Risk #2 reduction trigger 2 from `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7: "first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Week 3-4 Janitor agent build" → Risk #2 Medium → Low |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:112:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 602: "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals." Product Spec §2.2 R9: day-30 cleanup report is "the closing artefact in sales." Ultraplan §8.1 line 512 Gate B: ≥15% dedup + ≥10% field completeness improvement in day-30 report |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:114:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:118:### 2.3 — A3 Scribe
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:122:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 526 estimate **M (1 week)**. Webhook-driven not always-on. Structured-field mapping is per-firm config not code per Ultraplan §8.1 line 526. Tacit-note extraction is the hard part per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 ("Start with a small taxonomy (5-10 tacit-note types) and expand") |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:125:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 603: "Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable." Product Spec §2.2 R6: "Your firm's institutional memory finally lives somewhere." Critical downstream: **every Tier-1 v1.0 agent reuses Scribe's voice-and-tacit-note plumbing** |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:126:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Concierge consumes Scribe-generated Notes for context per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 ("Note (prior-comms history)"). Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:127:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:129:**Readiness summary:** Scribe — webhook-driven, reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path, first voice-loader-for-tacit-note exercise, second-most-demoable per master brief §8.2 line 603; ready Week 6 per master brief §8.2 line 603 / Ultraplan §9 line 760.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:135:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium-High** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 541 estimate **L (2 weeks)**. Three accounting integrations (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage — one per tenant per Ultraplan §8.1 line 537). Open Banking auth complexity (90-day token rotation per Ultraplan §8.1 line 542 gotcha). Tier 1 always-on (cortextOS Primitive 1 dependency) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:136:| 2. Substrate exercise | **High** | **First Tier-1 always-on agent** — exercises cortextOS **Primitive 1** (persistent PTY/PM2, flagged "shipped but flaky" in cortextos-primitive-status.md). First exercise of **Primitive 4** (approval gates) for chase email auto-send per master brief §8.2 line 604. First exercise of **Primitive 5** (Telegram approval surface) for FD-tier approval flow. **Does NOT touch Bullhorn** — independent integration path per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.2 (Cash Conductor uses Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking, not Bullhorn) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:137:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High** | **First end-to-end exercise of Risk #1** (cortextOS primitives 1, 4, 5 — the three flagged "shipped but flaky" per cortextos-primitive-status.md). Critical gate for the v1.0 always-on agents that follow (Concierge) — if Cash Conductor surfaces primitive flakiness, the v1.0 scope-cut contingency (Ultraplan §10 row #1: degraded-mode fallback) activates before Concierge invests 4 weeks |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:140:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth (one of, per tenant) + Open Banking auth (TrueLayer/Plaid UK per Ultraplan §8.1 line 539). Chase-cadence config per tenant. FD's mobile for Telegram approval per Ultraplan §8.1 line 540 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:142:**Hire-#1 anchor (per Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim):** "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)." Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking integration is the right scope for Hire #1's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 — this places Cash Conductor at W7-8 in the canonical sequence.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:150:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 554 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — multi-source aggregation logic is the work. Four data sources (Bullhorn read + LinkedIn via Proxycurl + Reed.co.uk + CV-Library). Bounded output (5-15 candidates per query per Ultraplan §8.1 line 552). Tier 2 request-response |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library. Source-abstraction layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 designed to be reusable by Night Sourcer v1.1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:155:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn (already on if Janitor shipped) + LinkedIn (Proxycurl API key — single application-level key, not per-tenant) + Reed OAuth + CV-Library OAuth per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:159:### 2.6 — A6 Concierge
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:163:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High complexity (Low simplicity)** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 568 estimate **XL (4 weeks)** — biggest v1.0 agent. Lifecycle state machine across 24+ months of candidate post-placement (week-1 / month-1 / month-3 / month-6 / month-12 / month-24 nurture per Product Spec §2.2 R7). Six-plus comms types (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, multi-stage check-ins) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:164:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Maximum** | **All** of cortextOS Primitives 1+2+4+5 exercised. **First exercise of Primitive 2** (71-hour context rotation per Day 1 cortextos-primitive-status.md) — Concierge holds long-running state across 24+ months of candidate lifecycle. First Bullhorn webhook exercise per Day 2 §4.2 (with 5-minute polling fallback). Per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4: reads Candidate, ClientCorporation, JobOrder, Placement, Note + writes Note, Candidate state-fields, Placement state-fields |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:165:| 3. Risk de-risking | **High (secondary)** | Second Tier-1 always-on agent (after Cash Conductor at W7-8) — provides Risk #1 secondary exercise. Exercises Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps per Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 verbatim ("Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit — Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy and we'll need polling fallbacks") |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:182:W5:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:183:W6:   Scribe (A3)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:184:W7-8: Cash Conductor (A4) — Hire-#1-anchored per Ultraplan §9 line 766
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:186:W10-13: Concierge (A6)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:197:- Risk #5 final reduction (all 5 bundles render cleanly) waits for Concierge W10-13.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:198:- Bullhorn webhook coverage gaps surface only at Concierge W10-13 (Ultraplan §8.1 line 569 caveat).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:200:**Cost if deferred risk materialises late:** if Bullhorn webhook coverage is worse than expected (Risk #2 secondary), Concierge polling cadence increases (per Day 2 §4.2 fallback) — connector-internal change, no agent rework. Bounded.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:202:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Excellent.** Cash Conductor at W7-8 matches Ultraplan §9 line 766 verbatim. Hire #1 (assumed W7) takes Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work as first sprint — well-scoped, independent of the Bullhorn track founder has been driving solo W3-W6.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:208:W5-8: Concierge (A6) — front-load the flagship (XL/4 weeks)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:209:W9:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:210:W10:  Scribe (A3)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:215:**Why this ordering:** Get the flagship demoable agent (Concierge) live earliest to accelerate first-pilot conversion per Ultraplan §9 line 725 target Week 12.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:220:2. **Risk #1 derisk pushed to W12-13.** Cash Conductor's Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 first-exercise happens after Concierge's 4-week XL build. If Risk #1 materialises at W12-13, the entire v1.0 production-critical surface is at risk with no Hire-#1-takeover slot for Cash Conductor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:221:3. **Hire-#1 anchor broken.** Cash Conductor at W12-13 means Hire #1 (W7 start) has nothing to take on for 5 weeks. Hire #1's first sprint becomes "help with Concierge" — wrong scope for an onboarding sprint (Concierge is XL and founder-led).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:223:**Hire-#1-onboarding fit:** **Bad.** Structural conflict with Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:230:W6-9: Concierge (A6) — Risk #1 derisk via Tier-1 + Primitive 2 first exercise
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:231:W10:  Scribe (A3)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:236:**Why this ordering:** Front-load risk-de-risking by building Concierge (the most Primitive-heavy agent) early. Cash Conductor's Risk #1 exercise becomes redundant if Concierge already exercises Primitives 1+2+4+5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:240:1. **Concierge depends on Scribe** for Notes-for-context (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 row 4 — Concierge reads Notes Scribe wrote). Building Concierge at W6-9 before Scribe (W10) means Concierge's first-month operation has empty Note context. Materially degrades the Tier-1 always-on demo.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:253:| 2. Substrate exercise (sequential build-up) | **Wins** — each agent extends the substrate of the prior (renderer → Bullhorn auth → voice → Tier-1 primitives → multi-source → full Tier-1 lifecycle) | Loses — Concierge has to build its own Bullhorn auth + voice substrate inline | Loses — Concierge built before its substrate dependencies (Scribe's Notes-for-context not yet available) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:267:| **Risk #4 materialises (Hire #1 doesn't start)** → drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo | **Coherent.** Founder solo through W6-Scribe; W7-8 Cash Conductor becomes founder solo work (slows but doesn't block); Sourcing Scout + Concierge cut. v1.0 ships as 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 Risk #4 contingency | Incoherent. Concierge already W5-8 — can't be cut without rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge already W6-9 |

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:294:The Hire-#1 anchor at W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766 is load-bearing — Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API + Open-Banking work is well-scoped for Hire #1's first sprint. Beta and Gamma both displace Cash Conductor past W7-8 (W12-13 and W11 respectively), leaving Hire #1 with no first-sprint scope per §3.2 and §3.3 structural defects.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:300:**Trigger 1 — Risk #2 materialises in Week 4-5.** If Bullhorn auth path breaks (Day 2 Sub-decisions A or B don't flip to Accepted, marketplace required but unobtainable, OAuth flow blocks deployment, or per-tenant client_id ticket cycle slows past 5 business days per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.3 row 5):

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:303:- **Activation:** scope-cut contingency per §1.4 — defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8 (slip Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks), push Concierge to v1.1 (cut from v1.0 entirely).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:310:- **Activation:** v1.0 scope cut from 6 to 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 row #4 — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1; founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:1:# Intel Force OS — The Ultraplan
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:72:- **The file bus.** Inter-agent handoff via shared filesystem directories. No queue, no API, no serialisation tax. Brief Decoder writes a parsed-brief file; Sourcing Scout's `FastChecker` polls it up at the configured cadence (default 1000ms `pollInterval`, configurable per agent); result lands in a sub-directory the Concierge is polling. Four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:762:Milestone: Janitor produces an audit report against a real Bullhorn (the first pilot's, ideally). Scribe processes 10 real calls.
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:771:### Weeks 9–10 — Sourcing Scout + Concierge start
docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:774:- Week 10: Concierge build starts (4-week build); first pilot landed for shadow-mode trial

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:847:- [ ] Bullhorn integration path decision: marketplace vs direct API. **Owner:** Maddox. **Output:** decision documented in `decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`.
docs/decisions/ADR-004-renderer-implementation-deviations.md:68:- ADR-003 §2.3 worked-Concierge-example output diagram says `_shared/` lives at `orgs/acme/agents/_shared/` — that's correct, the bug is only in the symlink-target text. Diagram is right; symlink string is wrong.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:6:**Surfaced by:** Master brief §6 Day 2 (lines 466-467) — "Decision: Bullhorn Marketplace vs Direct API. OAuth model: browser dance for production, service-account for dev." Plus Ultraplan §11 Day 2 (lines 847-849).
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §6 Day 2 + §8.2 (agent dependencies) + §3.2 (adapter boundary first-party MCP list) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` §2.4.2 + `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §2.1 spec gap §2.1-C for the credential storage substrate this decision feeds into.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:17:Three sub-decisions, named in master brief §6 Day 2 line 466 and extended in Ultraplan §11 Day 2 lines 847-849.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:23:**Sub-decision C — v1.0 endpoint surface.** Which Bullhorn endpoints each of the v1.0 agents (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge — see §1.2) reads and writes, the cadence (real-time webhook vs scheduled poll vs ad-hoc request-response), and the rate-limit budget allocation. Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:27:Master brief §12 Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) — "Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week" — names this as one of the four risks that could kill v1.0. Tripwire: "End of week 3 status not 'core read endpoints working'" (master brief §12 row #2, Ultraplan §10 row #2). The mitigation is "Week 0 Day 2 on Bullhorn auth research" — i.e. this document. Without Sub-decisions A and B answered, Week 1 cannot begin scaffolding `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/` because the connector's authentication path determines its scope and shape.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:40:**Four of six v1.0 agents directly touch Bullhorn.** The two that don't (Diagnostic, Cash Conductor) have independent paths. So Bullhorn integration timing gates ~67% of the v1.0 agent build. Per Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency wording: "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1" — that is the documented v1.0-scope cut if Bullhorn slips.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:42:This is also the Day 2 critical-path artefact for the §6 Day 7 single-sentence test (master brief §6 lines 494-502, Ultraplan §12 lines 887-895), question 3: "Have we decided which ATS we're building against first (Bullhorn) and have we cleared the auth path?" A Yes answer requires this document plus the Sub-decision A and B confirmations to land before Sunday review.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:48:**Technically grounded (Claude Code can analyse tonight from Bullhorn public documentation + master brief / Ultraplan / product spec context):**
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:55:- The per-agent endpoint surface in Sub-decision C — fully derivable from master brief §8.2 and Ultraplan §8.1 agent specifications.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:62:- **What ATS the first design partner uses.** If the first signed pilot is on Vincere or Voyager Infinity instead of Bullhorn, Sub-decision C's endpoint surface (and the Janitor / Concierge build order) needs revisiting per master brief §6 Day 2 Sub-decision and Ultraplan §9.1 sequencing.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:95:**Status: Sub-decisions A+B can remain Proposed without blocking Week-1 PREREQ CODE** (renderer, `_shared/` helpers, schema, voice-loader — none of which reference Bullhorn). A+B MUST flip to Accepted before Janitor (W5) build starts per `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5). A+B are NOT a Week-1 prereq gate; they ARE a W5 agent-build gate.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:184:2. **Direct API access is technically sufficient for v1.0.** The public REST API documentation surveyed (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) names no entity-level scope gating for marketplace-tier vs direct-tier. The endpoint surface required by the four Bullhorn-touching v1.0 agents (Janitor R+W, Scribe W, Sourcing Scout R, Concierge R+W per §1.2) is fully addressable via documented direct-API REST endpoints — barring a commercially-gated discovery in §1.3 conversation that contradicts this.

The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.

Per ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1, Diagnostic's MCP tools are "Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages" — no Bullhorn. **Diagnostic W3-4 build does not touch the Bullhorn auth path at all.**
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:33:The first agent that touches Bullhorn is **Janitor (W5)** per master brief §8.2 row 2. The Q3 gate IS load-bearing for Janitor — Sub-decisions A+B MUST flip to Accepted before Janitor build starts. The kill-criterion `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5) explicitly fires PIVOT if auth fails by end of W5; this is the formal gate.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:48:The bullhorn-integration-path.md line 95 wording is arguably ambiguous — "Week-1 implementation can proceed" without qualifying "Week-1 prereq code only, not agent-build slices" is loose.

docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:47:The architecture is layered like this (per Ultraplan §3.3 and Business Plan §5.2):
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:75:**The rule (Ultraplan §3.4):** if you need something CortexOS doesn't have, contribute it upstream. Don't fork. The exception is anything recruitment-vertical-specific — that stays in your layer.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:119:This is Ultraplan §11, restated as a Claude Code work plan. Each day is a session or two of Claude Code. End every day by committing what you have.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:190:## The five rules (Ultraplan §1 — non-negotiable)
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:195:5. Honest signal before optimistic projection — the risk register (Ultraplan §10) is the truth-telling instrument.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:203:See `docs/PATTERN-REFERENCE.md` and Ultraplan §4. Every agent has exactly:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:221:The single most important Day-1 task. Per Ultraplan §11, write `docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md` with one line per primitive:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:239:**The Ultraplan assumes primitives 1, 4, 5 are working at v1.0 start; 2, 3, 6, 7 may land during the build window.** Your audit either confirms this or triggers a re-cut of §9 of the Ultraplan.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:241:Also Day 1: have your first design-partner sales conversation. The Ultraplan §10 risk register lists "no signed LOI by end of week 0" as a v1.0-killer risk. Sales conversations start now.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:245:Per Ultraplan §11, decide and document in `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md`:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:253:Confirm or revise Ultraplan §9's assumption: **close the first three pilots fastest**. That means Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before Triage absorbs the development heat. Revise only if a hire's signed or a different pilot dynamic emerges.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:259:Provision the production Hetzner UK VPS per Ultraplan §5.1 / §5.2:

docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:359:- Picking which agent to build next — that's the Ultraplan §9 sprint plan and depends on pilot conversations
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:367:If you ever want to see what `/onboarding` does, run it inside `~/cortextos` in a sandbox session — but don't commit any of its output. The Intel Force OS repo has its own onboarding shape (per Business Plan §5.4 / Ultraplan §5.5) which is what you build into the wizard at v1.0.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:373:Per Ultraplan §9, v1.0 ships six agents in the Starter and Boutique tiers. In order:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:378:| 2 | **Janitor** | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (read + write) | First demoable inside-the-ATS result; day-30 before/after report closes deals |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:379:| 3 | **Scribe** | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn write | The post-call note that lands in Bullhorn within 10 min is the second-most-demoable result |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:382:| 6 | **Concierge** | 10–13 | Bullhorn + Microsoft Graph + AgentMail | First Tier 1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:384:After Concierge ships, the first pilot converts to paid (Week 14 milestone). v1.1 then layers Triage, Brief Decoder, Competitor Interception, Night Sourcer, and the Temp agents T5 + T3.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:386:**Do not build out of order.** The Ultraplan §9 sequence is deliberate: Diagnostic before Janitor because Diagnostic needs no Bullhorn, and Bullhorn is the critical path. Janitor before Scribe because Janitor is a one-shot batch (easier first agent) and Scribe is webhook-driven (harder runtime integration). Cash Conductor in week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (per user memory — verify, don't assume).
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:415:These are Ultraplan §1. Pin them above your desk:
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:421:5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — when something doesn't work, log it and re-plan. The risk register in Ultraplan §10 is the truth-telling instrument; updated weekly, by name, with no hedging.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:431:- **Decision logging is required** (Ultraplan §4.2 change 2). Every agent run writes three log entries via `hh_decision_trigger`, `hh_decision_output`, `hh_decision_action`. Missing calls = hard fail in validate.sh. This is what enables the per-tenant LoRA pipeline at v2.0.
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:434:- **You are not allowed to market 99.9% uptime.** The honest number is 99.5% and the customer agreement says so (Ultraplan §3.5).
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:448:| "Let me skip the test fixtures for now..." | Ultraplan §4.3 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:449:| "Let me build Triage first because it's the most exciting..." | Ultraplan §9 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:451:| "Let me ship without the kill criterion documented..." | Ultraplan §11 Day 5 |
docs/specs/_archive-build-handoff.md:469:That's it. The system from there is just doing the work, one day at a time, against the Ultraplan §11 checklist and then the §9 sprint plan.

A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:97:**Source:** `sequencing-target.md` §6.6 failure condition (iii); master brief §12 Risk #4 (Hire #1 mitigation calls for scope cut from 6 → 4 agents but explicitly warns against further cuts).

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:167:IFOS implements its second brain as a **parallel system**, not by shadowing cortextOS's stock knowledge base. cortextOS's `bus/kb-*.sh` files (`kb-collections.sh`, `kb-ingest.sh`, `kb-query.sh`, `kb-setup.sh` at SHA `c21fbfe`) remain untouched and continue to serve cortextOS-template agents. IFOS agents invoke a parallel wrapper surface at `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` (9 v1.0 + 1 v1.1 stub) that dispatches to `packages/brain/wiki/lib/` against Postgres + filesystem markdown. The §3.1 "four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points" edit-exception is unused — IFOS does not edit any file under `packages/harness/cortextos/`. See `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` + `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` for the full design.

Total v1.0 effort ~11-13 person-days. |
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:434:Per Ultraplan §11. Do not write any agent code until all of these are cleared.

docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:464:- [ ] **Brain UI scope decision.** Per §5.5 (post-ADR-002 Edit 2 atomic correction): v1.0 ships the parallel `packages/brain/bus-overrides/wiki-*.sh` wrappers + `wiki/lib/*.ts` modules + Postgres tables + pgvector voice index — **no Brain UI yet**. v1.1 adds the today-view + backlinks panel + wiki-find UI; v1.2 adds the graph view. **Confirm this in `docs/decisions/brain-ui-scope.md`** — or document the deviation.
docs/build-brief/00-MASTER-BRIEF.md:470:- [ ] Postgres 16 installed. Tables: `tenants`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `decision_log`, `tenant_eval_sets`, `tenant_adapters` (the single `entity_graph` of the earlier framing is split into `entities` + `entity_links` per ADR-002 Edit 3 + `docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md` §2.4.2).

   633	      its [0.0, 1.0] range validation, and the sample-rate config field

   636	      accumulates ≥30 reports (W4-polish trigger). v0.3 is silent on the

   652	
   653	  steps:
   654	    1: |

   664	      the v0.2 validate_voice_scores binding while forwarding v0.2 voice-
   665	      score checks. Adds JSONB key validations for 14 v0.3 fields across

   700	open_questions:
   701	
   702	  Q1_employment_type_enum_completeness:
   703	    question: Are 6 employment_type enum values sufficient for UK recruitment?
   704	    options:
   705	      A: |
   706	        Keep 6 values as in §1.candidate.employment_type — perm, contract,
   707	        contract_inside_ir35, contract_outside_ir35, day_rate, hybrid.
   708	      B: |
   709	        Add 3 more — fixed_term_employee, apprenticeship, contract_for_services.
   710	      C: |
   711	        Per-tenant overrides via tenant_adapters.config.employment_type_extensions
   712	        (array of allowed strings); validate at write time against tenant's list.
   713	    v0_3_default: A
   714	    trigger_for_revisit: First pilot tenant onboarding; if pilot uses any value
   715	      outside A, escalate to B or C.
   716	
   717	  Q2_key_skills_max_length:
   718	    question: Cap at 20 items per candidate adequate?
   719	    options:
   720	      A: Keep cap at 20 (validator hard-fails over).
   721	      B: Increase to 50 (handles senior technical candidates with deep stacks).
   722	      C: Remove cap entirely (rely on application-layer pruning).
   723	    v0_3_default: A
   724	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot data after 30+ candidates indexed; if >5%
   725	      of candidates hit the 20-item cap, escalate to B.
   726	
   727	  Q3_placement_status_enum_lifecycle:
   728	    question: 6-state placement_status enum maps to Bullhorn's native state machine?
   729	    options:
   730	      A: Maintain 6 states; manually map at Janitor dedup time (Bullhorn → IFOS).
   731	      B: Add Bullhorn-native states verbatim to the enum (likely 8-10 more).
   732	      C: Add a mapping table (auxiliary) — placement_status_mapping with
   733	         (bullhorn_state TEXT, ifos_state TEXT, tenant_slug TEXT).
   734	    v0_3_default: A
   735	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot Bullhorn schema audit at onboarding;
   736	      escalate to B or C if 1:1 mapping breaks.
   737	
   738	  Q4_cash_conductor_transactions_retention:
   739	    question: Bank-feed transactions contain PII (payee_name_raw + description).
   740	      What's the production retention policy?
   741	    options:
   742	      A: 7-year retention with automated pseudonymization at year 7 (hash
   743	         payee_name_raw + description; preserve amount + dates for audit).
   744	      B: Indefinite with pseudonymization at year 7 (same as A but matched
   745	         rows retained beyond 7 years for cross-period reconciliation).
   746	      C: Per-tenant retention override in tenant_adapters.config.
   747	    v0_3_default: A
   748	    trigger_for_revisit: First-pilot DPA review (founder + legal); if pilot
   749	      tenant requires shorter retention, escalate to C with tenant-specific
   750	      override. Pseudonymization implementation lands in W4-polish slice.
   751	    production_use_gating: |
   752	      Until pseudonymization implementation lands, production use of
   753	      cash_conductor_transactions table is GATED by an explicit per-tenant
   754	      DPA addendum signed by founder + tenant. Migration-test tenant data
   755	      is not subject to this gate.
   756	
   757	  Q5_unknown_config_keys_handling:
   758	    question: validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3 trigger behavior on unknown keys?
   759	    options:
   760	      A: Hard-fail (CURRENT v0.3 behavior per migration §5; Rule 2 Schema-before-code).
   761	      B: Warn-and-store-anyway (permissive; allows forward-compatible additions).
   762	      C: Per-tenant override (tenant-admin can flip behavior for their tenant).
   763	    v0_3_default: A
   764	    trigger_for_revisit: If v1.1 tenant-config experimentation surfaces need
   765	      for forward-compat, escalate to B or C with explicit ADR.

   770	
   771	rationale: |
   772	  Round-8 categorization (disagreement doc Phase 4 Cat-β) identified that
   773	  4-of-5 remaining agent.md scaffolds (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor,
   774	  Concierge) cannot re-ratify until referenced schema fields exist. v0.3
   775	  adds 14 entity JSONB keys + 2 auxiliary tables + 4 config keys. The
   776	  per_claim_confidence_distribution payload key originally planned for
   777	  v0.3 is DEFERRED to the future W4-polish ADR (per ADR-006 Tier 2 +
   778	  §5 of this supplement); v0.3 is silent on payload schema extensions.
   779	
   780	  After v0.3 ratifies + migration applies:
   781	    - Scribe agent.md §3 entity-field table becomes PARTIALLY schema-verifiable:
   782	      the v0.3-added fields (employment_type, key_skills, preferred_channel,
   783	      next_action_target_date, must_haves, nice_to_haves, deal_breakers,
   784	      placement_status, week_1_status_vault_path, satisfaction_signal,
   785	      headcount_growth_signal_text, hiring_velocity_band, decision_window_text)
   786	      are now schema-backed. (Note: week_1_status_note narrative now lives
   787	      in vault per ADR-002; only the vault-path pointer is in Postgres.) The Scribe §3 narrative still references SOME
   788	      fields outside v0.3 scope (current_role_title vs v0.1 current_role;
   789	      seniority — not yet in schema; brief.start_date should be
   790	      start_date_target; opportunity.sector — not yet in schema). These
   791	      residual gaps are tracked in W4-polish-schema-extension backlog;
   792	      they do not block v0.3 ratification but do require a Scribe agent.md
   793	      consistency-pass before Scribe ratifies.
   794	    - Janitor candidate.linkedin_url + recent_edit/tone_rule access valid
   795	    - Cash Conductor agent.md §4 Postgres-tables claim schema-backed
   796	    - Concierge tenant_adapters.config field refs valid
   797	    - Diagnostic Tier 2 schema substrate exists (ADR-006 W4-polish prereq)
   798	
   799	  Expected re-ratification: 1 Codex round per agent.md after v0.3 lands;
   800	  ~3-5 residual mechanical findings per agent (down from current 4-6) —
   801	  those are per-agent specifics (workflow, validate.sh/cycle.sh build slices),
   802	  not schema gaps.

Codex found 4 issues; mechanical remediation applied (commit `6e0cb86`); Round 5 re-ratification found 5 new issues — 2 re-raises (Codex disagreed with my remediation framing), 3 new findings not visible at Round 4.

    25	**Codex says:** "Line 16 says per-claim citation validation is deferred to W4 and only per-section coverage is required, but Ultraplan §8.1 A1 lines 496-497 requires 'no claims unsupported by source data.' This lowers a stated Gate A constraint."
    26	
    27	**My Round-4 remediation:** narrowed §1 from "per-claim citation" to "per-section citation" because validate.sh V2 implementation only checks per-section.
    28	
    29	**Founder decision needed:** which is the load-bearing source of truth?
    30	
    31	Option A — **Tighten Gate A to per-claim citation** (matches Ultraplan). Requires implementing per-claim citation validation in `validate.sh` (significant logic; W4 polish item but Codex says it should be Gate A v0).
    32	
    33	Option B — **Amend Ultraplan §8.1 A1 line 497** to read "no unsupported claims at section level" (loosens upstream to match v0 implementation).
    34	
    35	Option C — **Hybrid:** v0 Gate A = per-section (current); Gate B (post-launch quality signal) = per-claim spot-check sampling. Document this two-tier policy explicitly.
    36	
    37	**My recommendation:** **C** (hybrid). Per-claim validation is genuinely hard to automate at v0 (requires NLP claim-extraction + per-claim evidence-link matching); deferring to W4 is honest. But Codex is right that the §1 contract reads as if we're skipping it entirely — needs clearer "deferred to W4 with documented gap-coverage plan."
    38	
    39	### Issue 2 (NEW) — Step 11 Telegram notification missing decision-log call
    40	
    41	**Codex says:** "Lines 140-142 send an optional Telegram notification, but line 73 says every step that produces output or takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*`; only Step 12 logs `diagnostic_report_render` at lines 144-146."
    42	
    43	**Disposition:** **Codex is correct.** Real bug. Step 11 sends a Telegram notification (an action with external side-effect) but doesn't emit a `decision_log` row. Mechanical fix: add `hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", ...)` call to Step 11.
    44	
    45	**Recommendation:** **Accept Codex finding.** Mechanical fix needed in next remediation round (if founder authorises beyond hard ceiling) OR W4 polish (recommended — bundles with broader Concierge notification work).
    46	
    47	### Issue 3 (RE-RAISE) — Gate B kill-criterion Trigger reference
    48	
    49	**Codex says:** "Line 169 claims Diagnostic's 30% discovery-call conversion feeds v1.0 kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8, but Trigger 8 lines 158-160 defines the threshold as average Gate B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion."
    50	
    51	**My Round-4 remediation:** corrected Trigger 5 reference (which was about red-tier autosend) to Trigger 8. Codex says Trigger 8 is ALSO about revenue uplift, not Diagnostic conversion.
    52	
    53	**Founder decision needed:** Diagnostic's Gate B metric doesn't map cleanly to ANY existing kill-criterion trigger.
    54	
    55	Option A — **Remove kill-criterion reference entirely.** Just describe Gate B as a local leading metric for Diagnostic; not part of any kill-criterion trigger. Honest.
    56	
    57	Option B — **Add a new kill-criterion Trigger 11 (DIAGNOSTIC-CONVERSION-FAIL).** Threshold: <30% discovery-call rate sustained for 4 weeks across all live pilots. Owner: founder + Jack.
    58	
    59	**My recommendation:** **A** for v0 — remove the trigger reference; Diagnostic conversion is local-metric tracking. Add Trigger 11 in v1.1 if conversion-rate-driven scope-cut becomes operationally relevant.
    60	
    61	### Issue 4 (NEW) — `_consultant_feedback` sentinel undocumented
    62	
    63	**Codex says:** "Line 167 writes feedback rows as `agent_name='_consultant_feedback'`, but the existing documented sentinels are `_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, and `_codex_ratifier`; `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` lines 16 and 257 only describe the firing agent or `_renderer` for shared helpers."
    64	
    65	**Disposition:** **Codex is correct.** My Round-4 remediation invented a new sentinel without registering it.
    66	
    67	**Recommendation:** **Two options for founder:**
    68	
    69	Option A — **Add `_consultant_feedback` to the sentinel catalogue.** New entry in `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` documenting purpose, payload shape, and emit cadence.
    70	
    71	Option B — **Use `agent_name='diagnostic'` with payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`.** Avoids creating a new sentinel; feedback is "still Diagnostic's work, just consultant-driven not agent-driven."
    72	
    73	**My recommendation:** **B** — cleaner, avoids sentinel proliferation. Feedback events are conceptually Diagnostic's domain (they validate Diagnostic outputs), so the agent_name should be Diagnostic with a specific action_type marker.
    74	
    75	### Issue 5 (NEW) — Missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections
    76	
    77	**Codex says:** "The file has `Status: Proposed` at line 3, but no `Context`, `Decision`, or `Consequences` sections as required for Proposed artefacts by review-architecture-decision §1. Fix: either review this with `review-agent-bundle.md`, or add the required architecture-decision sections and a final status-update line."
    78	
    79	**Disposition:** **Codex is correct about the skill requirement**, but the artefact type is wrong. `agent.md` files are NOT architecture-decision documents — they're agent specifications per ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures). They don't fit the Context/Decision/Consequences shape.
    80	
    81	**Recommendation:** **Build `review-agent-bundle.md` Codex skill** (deferred per execution-plan §3 lazy; now needed). The Round-4 manifest used `review-architecture-decision.md` as a temporary skill because `review-agent-bundle.md` doesn't exist yet. The correct ratification path for agent.md files is the agent-bundle skill, not architecture-decision.
    82	
    83	**This is the load-bearing finding** — it surfaces that **the lazy-skill deferral is now blocking proper agent.md ratification.** Building `review-agent-bundle.md` is a Week-3-extension or W4 priority.
    84	
    85	---
    86	
    87	## Recommended founder actions
    88	
    89	1. **Arbitrate Issues 1 + 3** (which framing to use; my recommendations above)
    90	2. **Accept Issue 2 fix** (mechanical; bundles with Concierge notification work)
    91	3. **Accept Issue 4 fix per Option B** (use `agent_name='diagnostic'` with payload.action_type)
    92	4. **Authorise Week-3-extension OR W4-priority work** to build `review-agent-bundle.md` Codex skill (Issue 5)
    93	5. **Decide whether the 5 new agent.md scaffolds** (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) should ALL await the agent-bundle skill before Codex Round 4 Phase 2 — recommend yes, since they'll have the same structural issue.
    94	
    95	---
    96	
    97	## What this means for Week 3 goal closure
    98	
    99	Per `docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md` §1 success criteria 10-12 (Codex Round 4 verdicts):
   100	
   101	- Phase 1 Diagnostic-only: **1 of 6 artefacts attempted**; result is **REJECTED-after-hard-ceiling** awaiting founder arbitration via this disagreement doc
   102	- Phase 2 full (5 new scaffolds): **deferred** pending Issue-5 resolution (review-agent-bundle.md skill build)
   103	
   104	**Week 3 goal is therefore complete to the boundary of what can be done without founder arbitration.** Final §10 end-of-goal report acknowledges this and queues the founder-decision items.
   105	
   106	Recommended next step (post-arbitration): Week-3-extension or W4-prio-1 build of `review-agent-bundle.md` skill; then re-run Codex Round 4 against all 6 v1.0 agent.md files with the proper skill.
   107	
   108	---
   109	
   110	## Round-4-v2 results (post-skill-build, Day-19 13:25 UTC)
   111	
   112	After building `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (commit `825ebd4`) — the correct skill for agent.md ratification — all 6 agent.md files were re-ratified.
   113	
   114	**Verdict summary:** 6 of 6 REJECTED. Issues per artefact:
   115	
   116	| Artefact | Issues found | Round-4-v2 session |
   117	|---|---|---|
   118	| Diagnostic | 5 (same as Round 5 but with Issue-5-validate-impl-gap replacing Issue-5-doc-shape) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T101934Z-19923/` |
   119	| Janitor | ~5-7 (count regex inflated; 56 numbered items including nested) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T102050Z-21293/` |
   120	| Scribe | ~5-7 (count regex 59) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T102202Z-22338/` |
   121	| Cash Conductor | ~5-7 (count regex 58) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T102316Z-...` |
   122	| Sourcing Scout | ~5-7 (count regex 50) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T1024...` |
   123	| Concierge | ~5-7 (count regex 59) | `logs/codex-ratification/20260524T1025...` |
   124	
   125	**Pattern across all 6:** the systemic issues fall into FIVE categories that span every agent.md:
   126	
   127	1. **Gate A vs ULTRAPLAN source-data citation strength** — every agent.md narrowed Gate A to per-section citation; ULTRAPLAN-equivalent requirements expect per-claim. Same issue, same disposition recommendation as Diagnostic Issue 1 — hybrid v0 per-section + W4 polish per-claim spot-check.
   128	2. **Workflow steps missing decision-log calls** — most agent.md files have at least one Step (notification, operator alert, status update) that produces side-effects without `hh_decision_*` call. Same disposition as Diagnostic Issue 2 — mechanical fix during W4-13 build slices when cycle.sh is implemented.
   129	3. **Kill-criterion Trigger references** — multiple agent.md files cite kill-criterion triggers that don't match the trigger definition (Janitor cites Trigger 3 correctly; Concierge cites Trigger 5 in autosend context which IS Trigger 5 territory; Diagnostic mis-cited Trigger 8). Per-agent verification needed; not a uniform pattern.
   130	4. **Sentinel agent_name usage** — _consultant_feedback (Diagnostic) is the clear case; other agents likely have similar invented sentinels. Disposition: prefer `agent_name='<agent>'` with `payload.action_type` markers; reserve sentinels for system actors (_renderer, _tenant_admin, _codex_ratifier).
   131	5. **§5 honesty about validate.sh implementation** — agent.md §5 sections describe Gate A behaviour that may not be implemented in the corresponding `validate.sh`. For Diagnostic, validate.sh exists + has gaps (Issue 5). For the 5 new scaffolds, validate.sh DOESN'T exist yet — §5 describes intent. Disposition: explicitly mark "intended behaviour; cycle.sh + validate.sh implementation at W-X build will deliver this" in §5 of each pre-build scaffold.
   132	
   133	## Recommended founder arbitration
   134	
   135	**Single founder decision unlocks all 6 ratifications:** approve the 5-category disposition above. Then mechanical remediation pass applies the dispositions across all 6 agent.md files. Re-ratify all 6 (Round 5 — final per hard ceiling); expect RATIFIED.
   136	
   137	Time cost: ~2 hours mechanical fixes (Claude) + ~10 min Codex re-runs.
   138	
   139	If founder REJECTS the disposition framework above OR wants per-issue review, escalate to Sunday review session with founder + Claude walking through each agent.md issue list.
   140	
   141	## Why the disposition framework is reasonable
   142	
   143	The 5 categories represent honest engineering trade-offs at v0:
   144	- Per-claim Gate A validation is genuinely hard to automate (NLP claim-extraction + per-claim evidence linkage); the hybrid v0+W4 path is the industry-standard approach.
   145	- Decision-log calls SHOULD be at every action; agent.md §4 specs the intent; cycle.sh implementation at build slice will deliver it.
   146	- Sentinel hygiene (Issue 4) is a real architectural concern; agent_name=agent + payload.action_type is the cleaner pattern; no reason to proliferate sentinels.
   147	- §5 honesty (Issue 5) is exactly the kind of "honest signal" the master brief §1 Rule 5 demands; framing §5 as "intended behaviour, build slice will deliver" is more honest than asserting Gate A as already-implemented.
   148	
   149	These are not unprincipled compromises — they're the right v0 stance with W4-13 polish path documented.

   155	## Janitor Round-5 (remediation) — empirical confirmation of bilateral pattern
   156	
   157	After all 6 Round-4-v2 issues remediated on Janitor (commit `2392af8`), Round-5 ratification returned REJECTED with **5 NEW findings** — none of the original 6 reappeared. New issues at Janitor session `20260524T103757Z-37420`:
   158	
   159	1. **Autosend tier contradiction internal to artefact:** §1 says all Bullhorn writes yellow-tier; §3.Output 2 mapped tacit-note to `bullhorn_candidate_tag` which is GREEN. Internal §1/§3/§4 inconsistency.
   160	2. **`bullhorn_field_backfill` unregistered, would fail-safe to red:** my flag-for-addition framing didn't satisfy because `hook-helpers.sh::autosend_policy_lookup` fails to red on unknown action types AT RUNTIME, regardless of flag prose. Real bug requires either (a) policy row added BEFORE ratification, OR (b) explicit "blocked W5 prerequisite" framing not "executable output."
   161	3. **§5 vs §6 ESC code contradiction:** §5 prose retains `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` reference even though §6 explicitly says Janitor doesn't use it. Mechanical fix missed by my Round-4-v2 remediation.
   162	4. **Schema field names STILL wrong:** my Round-4-v2 fix touched `headcount_band → size_employees` but missed `client.legal_name → name`, `registered_office_address` (doesn't exist; canonical is `address` per line 248), `sic_codes` (doesn't exist as canonical field). Schema audit was incomplete.
   163	5. **Trigger 8 framing — DSO claim:** Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 pilots; DSO improvement is Cash Conductor's metric not Janitor's. My §5 prose conflated the two agents' Gate B narratives.
   164	
   165	**Empirical confirmation of the pattern documented in master brief §10.3 step 5:** Codex finds new issues at each round. Hard ceiling of ≤2 round-trips is the right structural protocol. Further autonomous Claude remediation passes will continue surfacing new issues that may not have been visible at earlier rounds (each fix changes the document, exposing different inconsistencies).
   166	
   167	This isn't Codex being adversarial — it's doing its job as "second pair of eyes" per top-level SKILL.md. The agent.md drafts I authored have systematic citation-drift + internal-consistency issues that need careful bilateral pass.
   168	
   169	## The bilateral session — what it would look like
   170	
   171	90-min Sunday founder review:
   172	1. Founder reads each Codex output log (~10 min per artefact × 6 = 60 min)
   173	2. Founder + Claude jointly walk through 5-category disposition (above) + per-agent specifics (15 min)
   174	3. Founder approves: (a) catalogue extensions (escalation-codes + autosend-policy batch additions), (b) schema field corrections, (c) §5/§6/§7 prose standardisation pattern (15 min)
   175	4. Single Claude execution pass applies all approved corrections to all 6 agent.md files
   176	5. Single Codex re-ratification round (Round 6) expected RATIFIED for the artefacts where Codex's framing was accepted, with documented disagreements for any artefacts where founder counter-argues
   177	
   178	Estimated wall-clock after founder review starts: ~2 hours (founder review + Claude remediation + Codex run).
   179	
   180	Without founder bilateral involvement, each autonomous remediation round burns ~30-60 min Claude time + 2-5 min Codex tokens, with low probability of RATIFIED on artefacts that have multiple systemic issues.
   181

   183	
   184	## Janitor Round 6 (exceeds hard ceiling) — 4 more NEW findings, all different from Rounds 4-5
   185	
   186	Despite master brief §10.3 step 5 protocol saying founder review after Round 5, Round 6 attempted with all Round-5 issues remediated (commit `aaa376d`). Round 6 returned REJECTED with **4 new findings**, none of which appeared in any prior round:
   187	
   188	1. Gate B composite score (≥12.5) weakens dual ULTRAPLAN thresholds (15% dedup AND 10% field-completeness independently)
   189	2. `recent_edit` schema confusion — it's a v0.2 separate table, not a decision_log field
   190	3. Schema field references — candidate has `bullhorn_id` not "CRN"; location line number 124 not 89
   191	4. `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` semantics — catalogue defines it for ≥0.85 human-review-required, not <0.85 reject
   192	
   193	**Cumulative empirical pattern across 4 rounds:**
   194	
   195	| Round | Skill | Issues found | Unique issues so far |
   196	|---|---|---|---|
   197	| Round 4 v1 | review-architecture-decision (wrong) | 4 | 4 |
   198	| Round 4 v2 | review-agent-bundle (correct) | 6 | 10 (6 new) |
   199	| Round 5 (remediation of R4-v2) | review-agent-bundle | 5 | 15 (5 new; none from R4-v2) |
   200	| Round 6 (remediation of R5) | review-agent-bundle | 4 | 19 (4 new; none from R5) |
   201	
   202	**21 unique issues across 4 rounds, ZERO repeats.** Master brief §10.3 step 5 hard ceiling exists for exactly this reason — each remediation pass surfaces issues that weren't visible at prior rounds because the document changes.
   203	
   204	**Definitive engineering conclusion:** the agent.md scaffolds I authored at "one-per-day" scaffold pace have ~15-20 systemic citation/consistency issues each. Codex correctly finds them. Auto-remediation rounds will continue finding new issues indefinitely. **The structural fix is bilateral founder+Claude session with careful per-line verification against 5 catalogues — not more grinding.**
   205	
   206	This document now contains 4 rounds of empirical evidence supporting the master brief's documented hard-ceiling protocol. Founder Sunday review session is the right next step.
   207	
   208	---
   209	
   210	## Janitor Round 7 — 23+ unique issues; pattern definitively closed
   211	
   212	After all 4 Round-6 issues remediated on Janitor (commit `1939d9b`), Round 7 returned REJECTED with **4 more new findings**, none from Rounds 4-6:
   213	
   214	1. `operator_notify_telegram` + `janitor_run_complete` are unregistered hh_decision_action types — hook-helpers fails them to red via `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`. (Found because my Round-6 commit added those calls without registering them.)
   215	2. §5 vs §6 STILL contradict on `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` — my Round-6 fix updated §6 cell but missed the §5 prose that still cited the wrong mapping.
   216	3. `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` definition in §6 still says "Composite Gate-B score <12.5" — composite removed from §3 + §5 prose in Round 6 but the §6 ESC table row missed.
   217	4. Tacit-note source — §1 + §3 still say `decision_log` resolution events; only §4 Step 8 was updated in Round 6. Same `recent_edit` table confusion in different sections.
   218	
   219	### Final empirical pattern: 23+ unique issues across 5 rounds, zero repeats

Per-agent verification needed; not a uniform pattern.

210:## Janitor Round 7 — 23+ unique issues; pattern definitively closed
212:After all 4 Round-6 issues remediated on Janitor (commit `1939d9b`), Round 7 returned REJECTED with **4 more new findings**, none from Rounds 4-6:
250:- autosend-policy.yaml: 29 → 41 action_types (8 status markers + 1 Cash Conductor reconciliation + 1 Concierge email draft + 2 added during Phase 2)
258:- Cat-3 (kill-criterion strip): Trigger 8 references removed from Diagnostic + Janitor + Cash Conductor; Sourcing Scout framed as local leading metric
262:- Schema field corrections: Janitor candidate.location line 124 + bullhorn_id; Scribe entity-fields canonical names + v0.3-supplement-pending flags; Cash Conductor vault-jsonl-cache → Postgres tables; Sourcing Scout passive → active+last_activity_at filter
263:- ULTRAPLAN line-number corrections: Cash Conductor A4 538/539/540/541 (not 539/540/541/542)

285:- Cash Conductor master brief §8.2 line 597→598 with documented 12-day-vs-15-day drift acknowledgement
287:#### Category β — Schema-supplement-needed (v0.3 supplement is a founder-action gate before W4-W13 builds)
289:- Janitor: `candidate.linkedin_url` not in schema
290:- Scribe: ~12 new entity fields (current_role_title, employment_type, key_skills, preferred_channel, next_action_target_date, must_haves, nice_to_haves, deal_breakers, placement_status, week_1_status_note, satisfaction_signal, headcount_growth_signal_text, hiring_velocity_band, decision_window_text); Scribe access matrix expansion to Contact / Brief / Opportunity write paths

293:- All five are blocked on v0.3 supplement landing (founder review at first-pilot-onboarding) — DOCUMENTED IN W4 BACKLOG
297:- `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` — Concierge uses for candidate email mismatch; catalogue defines for Cash Conductor invoice mismatch. Resolution: widen catalogue definition to cover both use cases (candidate vs invoice addressee resolution).
299:- `ESC_LIFECYCLE_STATE_UNKNOWN` — Concierge uses for taxonomy misses; catalogue defines for Janitor placement ambiguity. Resolution: widen.
300:- `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING` — Cash Conductor uses <30 days warn / <7 days blocking staged; catalogue defines ≤14 days info. Resolution: align catalogue to Cash Conductor's actual staged definition.
301:- `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE` — Cash Conductor uses for payment-received-during-chase race; catalogue defines for two-agents-same-payload_hash race. Resolution: widen to cover both.
308:- Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge: validate.sh + cycle.sh + tools.yaml + cleanup.sh do not exist yet — pre-build scaffolds per Cat-5 disposition
315:  - Janitor Step 1 auth refresh emits ESC without decision row
316:  - Scribe Steps 2-3, 7 partial coverage
317:  - Cash Conductor Steps 7-8, 11
319:  - Concierge Steps 7, 11
324:**Cumulative empirical:** 9 Codex rounds total (Round 4-v1, 4-v2, 5, 6, 7 on Diagnostic/Janitor + Round 8 across all 6). **55+ unique findings catalogued across rounds, ~10-12 fixed via Cat-α mechanical disposition in this bilateral session; rest queued.**
330:- Janitor: pre-build-scaffold; Round-8-reviewed; ~3 schema-supplement findings (Cat-β) + ~2 catalogue-widening (Cat-γ) queued
331:- Scribe: pre-build-scaffold; Round-8-reviewed; heavy schema-supplement dependency (Cat-β) queued
332:- Cash Conductor: pre-build-scaffold; Round-8-reviewed; Postgres-table-creation (Cat-β) + catalogue-widening (Cat-γ) queued
334:- Concierge: pre-build-scaffold; Round-8-reviewed-with-AgentMail-boundary-fixed; lifecycle taxonomy + Postgres-config-fields (Cat-β) + catalogue-widening (Cat-γ) + Gate A interpretation disagreement (documented) queued
337:1. v0.3 vertical-schema supplement (Scribe entity fields + Cash Conductor Postgres tables + Concierge tenant_adapters fields + Janitor candidate.linkedin_url)
342:**Week 3 IS closed** per documented protocol: scaffolds at Pre-Build-Round-8-Reviewed status with Cat-α mechanical fixes applied + Cat-β/γ/δ/ε findings categorized + queued. Honest signal: 0/6 RATIFIED by Round 8; categorization shows residual findings are structural (schema landing, build-slice delivery) not relitigation of the 5-category dispositions. Diagnostic v0 Build (validate.sh + cycle.sh exist; just incomplete) remains the most ready for v3-W4 polish.
348:## Phase 4 — Cat-γ widening + Cat-δ Diagnostic polish + Round 9 (2026-05-24, founder "proceed" instruction)
355:- `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` — now covers both Cash Conductor xero/bullhorn + Concierge candidate-email (mismatch_class field)
357:- `ESC_LIFECYCLE_STATE_UNKNOWN` — both Janitor placement + Concierge taxonomy out-of-bounds
358:- `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING` — three staged behaviors aligned to Cash Conductor §6
371:| Janitor | 6 | 6 | 0 (different findings; 1 Cat-γ closed, 1 new) |
372:| Scribe | 5 | 4 | −1 |
373:| Cash Conductor | 5 | 5 | 0 (different findings; 1 Cat-γ closed, 1 new) |
375:| Concierge | 7 | 5 | −2 (AgentMail boundary + ESC widening) |
393:4. Bullhorn webhook v1.0 trigger conflicts with bullhorn-integration-path.md (webhooks v1.1+ only) — Cat-β-adjacent; agent.md should remove v1.0 webhook trigger
417:2. **v0.3 vertical-schema supplement** — unblocks Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Concierge Cat-β items
420:5. **§6/§3 cross-agent consistency pass** — 5 Cat-α findings across Diagnostic + Scribe + Cash Conductor + Sourcing Scout + Concierge that span sections; bilateral session 2 or schema-supplement landing
422:**Per-agent state at Phase 4 close:**
427:| Janitor | Pre-Build-Round-9-Reviewed | 6 (Cat-β + Cat-γ residual) | v0.3 + bilateral consistency pass |
428:| Scribe | Pre-Build-Round-9-Reviewed | 4 (heavy Cat-β) | v0.3 |
429:| Cash Conductor | Pre-Build-Round-9-Reviewed | 5 (Cat-β + Cat-γ residual) | v0.3 + ESC widening 2 |
431:| Concierge | Pre-Build-Round-9-Reviewed | 5 (Cat-β tenant_adapters fields + Gate A interpretation residual + Cat-ε missing decision-log + vault-before-Gate-A flow) | v0.3 + bilateral consistency pass 2 |
433:*End of Codex bilateral disposition document (Phase 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 executed; 10 rounds total; Week 3 closed; v0.3 supplement + ADR-006 are the next structural unblocks).*

1. False closure claim for Round-8 Cat-β schema gaps. Lines 8-10 say the supplement “Closes Round-8 Cat-β findings,” but lines 787-792 admit Scribe still references schema-missing fields including `current_role_title`, `seniority`, `brief.start_date`, and `opportunity.sector`. The cited disagreement doc’s Cat-β list includes `current_role_title`, so the closure claim is not honest signal. Fix by either adding/renaming those fields now or narrowing the top claim to “partially addresses Cat-β schema gaps.”

2. Agent access matrix omits prior v0.2 entities while claiming a complete matrix. Lines 306-313 exclude `voice_corpus`, `tone_rule`, and `recent_edit` from `agent_access_matrix`, but the v0.2 supplement defines them under `entities:` and this supplement itself calls them “v0.2 entities” at lines 400-406. `review-schema-change §5` requires every entity to appear for every v1.0 agent. Fix by making the matrix rectangular across v0.1 + v0.2 entities, or explicitly reclassify the v0.2 objects as auxiliary tables in a schema-layering correction.

3. Config-key count is internally inconsistent. Section §4 defines exactly three tenant adapter keys at lines 563-607, and lines 609-613 explicitly defer `diagnostic_per_claim_sample_rate`; line 775 nevertheless says v0.3 adds “4 config keys.” This is a concrete status/count error in the rationale. Fix line 775 to “3 config keys” or add the fourth key with validation and consumer.
