=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing

**Status:** Proposed (2026-05-24 pre-W9-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice + tenant_adapters.config v0.4-supplement adding blocked_recipients + auto_source_on_brief_create).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button, Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`), OR webhook from a "new brief" event in Bullhorn (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547). Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Brain UI (v1.0 primary)

Brain UI v1.0 "Source candidates" button on any brief detail page → POST internal API → Sourcing Scout webhook.

### Telegram command (v1.0)

```
@ifos_bot scout <brief-id-or-slug>
@ifos_bot scout --description "Senior React engineer, London, £120k, hybrid"
```

### Webhook (v1.0)

Bullhorn "new brief created" webhook → routed via internal bus → Sourcing Scout if tenant config enables `auto_source_on_brief_create` (v0.4-supplement-pending tenant_adapters.config key; v0.3 schema does NOT register this key — webhook-trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 supplement lands).

### CLI (v1.0 — debugging)

```bash
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --brief-id <id>
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --description "<free-text>"
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Night Sourcer Tier-1 always-on (Brain UI dashboard; cortextOS primitive #6)
- Bulk-source mode (`--brief-list briefs.csv`)
- Refresh-source mode (re-source against the same brief 30 days later)

---

## §3 — Output shape

One output per invocation. Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`. Structure:

```markdown
# Sourcing Scout — <Brief title>
**Generated:** <ISO-date>  **Brief ID:** <Bullhorn-brief-id>  **Tenant:** <slug>
**Sources searched:** Bullhorn ATS + LinkedIn (Proxycurl) + Reed + CV-Library
**Aggregate candidates:** <N> (top 5-15 ranked)

## Brief context
<2-3 sentences summarising the role from the brief input>

## Ranked candidates

### 1. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.92
**Source:** Bullhorn (passive match) | **Contact:** <method + verified>
**Match rationale:**
<≥50 words explaining why this candidate is a match — references brief
requirements + candidate background; cites Bullhorn placement history,
LinkedIn current role, or other source-specific evidence.>
**Risk flags:** <e.g., "active with placement at competitor agency 2024";
"prefers contract not perm per Bullhorn note">
**Profile links:** [Bullhorn](url) | [LinkedIn](url)

### 2. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.88
...

(5-15 candidates total)

## Source breakdown
| Source | Candidates contributed | Avg confidence | Rate-limit budget remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bullhorn ATS | <N> | <score> | n/a (no quota) |
| LinkedIn (Proxycurl) | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| Reed | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| CV-Library | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |

## Diagnostic + exception list
- <Any source failures (e.g., "Reed API 429; retried once; 3 candidates lost")>
- <Any "do not contact" filter hits>
- <Any low-confidence candidates discarded (below 0.5)>
```

Per `decision_log`: one row per source query + one row per candidate proposed + one final aggregate row.

Voice-classified content: only the per-candidate match rationale (Step 9). Voice classifier ≥0.75 against tenant style. Rationale that fails after 3 retries → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT → candidate dropped from list + flagged in exception list.

---

## §4 — Workflow

11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` (Postgres-
     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
     registered config key)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")

1. Brief ingestion
   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
     "key_dims:<N>")

2. Multi-source auth refresh
   → bullhorn (read-only); LinkedIn/Proxycurl; Reed; CV-Library
   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
       enters degraded mode per catalogue ("drafts-only, no auto-send" —
       Sourcing-Scout-specific interpretation: skip Bullhorn source +
       continue with other 3 sources, since Sourcing Scout has no
       auto-send path of its own; the "drafts-only" framing maps to
       "report-only with Bullhorn data omitted from the sourcing set")
     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (Sourcing Scout: cached LinkedIn search only; live profile fetches
       skipped)
     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
       Reed search results only)
     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (cached CV-Library search only)
   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>")

3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
     modification recency within the active set.
   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

4. LinkedIn search (via Proxycurl)
   → proxycurl.search_people(query=brief_key_dimensions, location=brief_location,
     industry=brief_sector)
   → up to 30 profiles
   → cache 1h per (query, location, sector) tuple
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Proxycurl quota hit (payload.upstream='linkedin')
   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

5. Reed query
   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='reed')
   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

6. CV-Library query
   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

7. Aggregate + dedupe
   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + LinkedIn
     match" if found in both)
   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")

8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)`
     (concept referenced by autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
     `send_to_blocked_recipient` action_type + ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT catalogue
     §2.10; the actual config-key SCHEMA registration is v0.4-supplement-
     pending — v0.3 supplement §4 only registers cash_conductor_last_run +
     concierge_last_poll + concierge_send_window. Production-readiness
     gate: v0.4 supplement must land before Sourcing Scout's DNC filter
     path runs against real pilot data. Postgres-backed per ADR-002
     vault/Postgres split — NOT vault markdown.)
   → remove any candidate matching any DNC identifier from the sourcing list
   → log dropped candidates to exception list in §3 output
   → NOTE: ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT is catalogue §2.10 reserved for OUTBOUND SEND
     REFUSAL specifically. Sourcing Scout filters DNC matches AT SOURCING
     TIME (pre-outbound); no outbound send attempt occurs. v0.3 disposition:
     log DNC drops in exception list only; no ESC fire. W4-polish backlog:
     add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER for the pre-outbound case.
   → hh_decision_output("dnc_filter", "brief:<id>",
     "dropped:<N>; kept:<N>")

9. LLM ranking + rationale generation (per candidate)
   → for top 15 by source-aggregated confidence: generate per-candidate
     rationale ≥50 words
   → prompt = (brief context + candidate profile + voice corpus + tone rules)
   → voice classifier scores rationale (≥0.75)
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries; drop candidate
     from final list
   → hh_decision_output("candidate_proposed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id|external_ref>",
     "source:<bullhorn|linkedin|reed|cvlibrary>; confidence:<N>; voice_score:<N>; included:<bool>") — emitted PER CANDIDATE per §3 contract (one row per candidate proposed; dropped candidates also get a row with included=false + drop_reason)

10. Output assembly + Gate A validation
    → ensure 5-15 candidates remaining after Step 9
    → ensure each has working contact method (email validated via simple
      regex + domain MX check; phone validated via E.164 format)
    → ensure each rationale ≥50 words
    → if any condition fails: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE (output-shape violation
      per catalogue line 184 — distinct from ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION which is
      reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time);
      partial draft to /tmp; abort
    → write Markdown report to vault path per §3
    → hh_decision_output("scout_report", report_path, "N candidates from M sources")

11. Session close + notification
    → operator notification per invocation source (Brain UI: in-app
      notification; Telegram: reply with report path; webhook: bus event back)
    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):

- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text → fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (BLOCKING per catalogue §2.5 lines 148-154; halts immediately, not warn-only output-shape)
- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)

Gate A failure routing by class:
- PII leakage → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall)
- Output-shape failures (count not in 5-15, contact-method missing, rationale <50 words, voice classifier miss, all-source-failure-without-degradation) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
Draft to `/tmp`; operator review.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.

Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply OR Bullhorn note. Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant.

Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).

Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | LinkedIn / Proxycurl session/OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / linkedin / reed / cv-library) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |

Sourcing Scout does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
| Q2 | Proxycurl pricing — ~$39/mo for 5,000 credits at low volume; scales with usage. Per pilot tenant budget? | ~5-10 briefs/day per consultant × 50 calls/brief = up to 2,500 credits/day per consultant. Cost: ~$20-50/day at peak. |
| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback. Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet. Telegram reply? | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful". v1.1: Brain UI button. |
| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)

1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built 2026-05-24, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
- Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
- Q6: ADR-006 (source-abstraction layer) drafted + ratified

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram OR Brain UI)
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

docs/architecture/tenancy-invariants.md:12:IFOS is multi-tenant SaaS. Every tenant runs the same agent fleet (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge in v1.0) against their own data, isolated from every other tenant's data. **A single cross-tenant data leak is a catastrophic failure mode** — it breaches the GDPR contract, violates pilot LOI terms, and burns customer trust. There is no "minor" cross-tenant leak.

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:1:# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:3:**Status:** Proposed (2026-05-24 pre-W9-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice + tenant_adapters.config v0.4-supplement adding blocked_recipients + auto_source_on_brief_create).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:6:**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:7:**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:8:**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:16:> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button, Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`), OR webhook from a "new brief" event in Bullhorn (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547). Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:267:Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply OR Bullhorn note. Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant.

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:351:**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:357:| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |

agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:359:| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:360:| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:363:| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:365:### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:367:1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md:368:2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.

Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511).

Master brief §2.4 row 3's "chokidar watcher in daemon" is incorrect against the verified SHA. The actual dispatcher is `FastChecker` polling at `pollInterval` (default 1000ms, configurable). Operational impact: message-delivery latency is bounded by the poll interval, not zero-latency event-driven; relevant for the Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge "four-agent pipelines complete in seconds" claim (Ultraplan §3.2). With 1s polling per hop and 3 hops, end-to-end is ≥3s, not sub-second.

docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:191:**Risk if flaky:** Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge pipeline (master brief §2.4 row 7) cannot complete in seconds; falls back to manual queue or scheduled cron, killing the "shortlist in 15 minutes" Sourcing Scout pitch. Separately, the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4 / §5) depends on the exact set of shadow points — until the file-name discrepancy is reconciled, our overrides won't intercept the correct calls and the wiki swap-out won't work.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:393:**Risk if flaky:** Night Sourcer becomes a daytime cron with rate-limit pain — kills the "Walk in to 27 reviewed candidates across your live briefs every morning" pitch (Product Spec §10 line 525). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6: "LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected → defer Night Sourcer to v1.2 if needed" — overnight autoresearch is also the budgeting layer for the LinkedIn rate limit (Ultraplan §8.2 A11 gotcha: "Build the rate-limit budget allocator carefully; this is where £40-60/mo of the £200 per-tenant compute cost lives").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:72:- **If Risk #4 (Hire #1 doesn't start) materialises** — drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1 (cut 2 of 6 agents); founder solo through end of v1.0.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:96:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **High** | Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY); no Bullhorn; single output (12-page audit report); Ultraplan §8.1 line 498 estimate **M (1 week)**. MCP servers: Companies House (free public API), LinkedIn (Proxycurl, read-only), web scraper for careers pages |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:113:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream: none.** **Downstream: load-bearing** — every subsequent Bullhorn-touching agent (Scribe W6, Sourcing Scout W9, Concierge W10-13) inherits the Bullhorn auth + refresh-loop + entity-mapping patterns Janitor establishes. Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:146:### 2.5 — A5 Sourcing Scout (daytime)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:150:| 1. Implementation simplicity | **Medium** | Ultraplan §8.1 line 554 estimate **L (2 weeks)** — multi-source aggregation logic is the work. Four data sources (Bullhorn read + LinkedIn via Proxycurl + Reed.co.uk + CV-Library). Bounded output (5-15 candidates per query per Ultraplan §8.1 line 552). Tier 2 request-response |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library. Source-abstraction layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 designed to be reusable by Night Sourcer v1.1 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:152:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:155:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn (already on if Janitor shipped) + LinkedIn (Proxycurl API key — single application-level key, not per-tenant) + Reed OAuth + CV-Library OAuth per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:185:W9:   Sourcing Scout (A5)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |

Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:113:**Source:** `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 + §10; Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (LUKS manual unlock has higher impact but autosend miscategorisation has higher frequency).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:136:**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:235:**Must-fill before first pilot LOI signs.** The pilot agreement may reference an external advisor for dispute resolution per `autosend-safety-policy.md` §10 placeholder language. Founder identifies and engages within Weeks 1-2.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:72:- **The file bus.** Inter-agent handoff via shared filesystem directories. No queue, no API, no serialisation tax. Brief Decoder writes a parsed-brief file; Sourcing Scout's `FastChecker` polls it up at the configured cadence (default 1000ms `pollInterval`, configurable per agent); result lands in a sub-directory the Concierge is polling. Four-agent pipelines complete in 3-5 seconds end-to-end. Off-the-shelf Lambda + Step Functions add a 3-8 second cold-start tax per hop, which compounds; our poll-based bus has a fixed floor that does not compound.

   535	- **MCP tools required:** Xero / QuickBooks / Sage (one of, per tenant), bank-feed connector
   536	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader, decision log writer, Telegram approval gate
   537	- **External APIs:** Xero API or QuickBooks API or Sage API; bank feed via Open Banking (TrueLayer / Plaid UK)
   538	- **Gate A:** chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact; never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h
   539	- **Gate B target:** tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline
   540	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — three accounting integrations × Open Banking is the work
   541	- **Gotchas:** Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial. Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic; start with exact-amount matches and expand to fuzzy.

   543	#### A5. Sourcing Scout (daytime form) — request-response sourcing
   544	
   545	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 8–9)
   546	- **Always-on?** Tier 2 — request-response
   547	- **Trigger type:** Brain UI button, Telegram command, or webhook from a "new brief" event
   548	- **CortexOS primitives required:** None for the daytime form (Night Sourcer in v1.1 will use #6)
   549	- **MCP tools required:** Bullhorn (read for ATS passive matches), LinkedIn (via Proxycurl or similar), Reed.co.uk API, CV-Library API
   550	- **Shared modules required:** Voice loader (for the rationale narrative), decision log writer
   551	- **External APIs:** Proxycurl, Reed, CV-Library
   552	- **Gate A:** 5–15 candidates returned per brief; each has a working contact method; each has rationale ≥ 50 words; no candidate flagged "do not contact" in tenant vault
   553	- **Gate B target:** ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)
   554	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the multi-source aggregation logic is the work
   555	- **Gotchas:** LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl. Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas. Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it.

   557	#### A6. The Concierge — no candidate ghosted
   558	
   559	- **Build wave:** v1.0 (week 9–10)

   154	- **Recovery:** Agent restart required after operator review; founder must determine whether DPO notification is needed per UK GDPR Art. 33
   155	
   156	#### `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT`
   157	- **Severity:** warn
   158	- **Trigger:** Upstream API rate-limited; especially LinkedIn (Sourcing Scout multi-source pulls) per master brief §8.1 Change 3 line 592 + bullhorn-integration-path.md §2.2 (Bullhorn 429s)

   162	
   163	#### `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`
   164	- **Severity:** warn

   176	
   177	#### `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL`
   178	- **Severity:** warn
   179	- **Trigger:** Agent rejected its input at the validation gate (e.g. malformed firm name, missing required CLI argument, brief description too short). Detected at Step 1 of the agent's workflow BEFORE any tool calls or LLM invocations
   180	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   181	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   182	- **Payload fields:** `input_field`, `input_value_preview` (truncated to 80 chars), `validation_rule_violated`
   183	
   184	#### `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`
   185	- **Severity:** warn
   186	- **Trigger:** Agent produced output that doesn't match its declared output shape (e.g. Diagnostic report with section count != 12, missing per-section citation, validate.sh V1/V2 check fail). Distinct from `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` which is for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time
   187	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   188	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   189	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `output_path`, `shape_rule_violated`, `expected_value`, `actual_value`

   238	Source: derived from v1.0 agent.md adapter references (Bullhorn, Reed, CV-Library, LinkedIn, Gmail, Outlook/MS Graph, Xero, Open Banking)
   239	
   240	#### `ESC_REED_AUTH`
   241	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent enters degraded mode (cached search results only)
   242	- **Trigger:** Reed jobs-board API OAuth token refresh failed twice OR REST call returned 401 indefinitely
   243	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   244	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   245	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type` (`refresh_failed` | `revoked_401`), `last_attempt_at`, `consecutive_failures`
   246	- **Recovery:** founder rotates Reed API key via Reed admin → `_secrets.env` reload
   247	
   248	#### `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH`
   249	- **Severity:** **blocking** — agent degraded (cached search only)
   250	- **Trigger:** CV-Library API OAuth failure (same pattern as ESC_REED_AUTH)
   251	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   252	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   253	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type`, `last_attempt_at`, `consecutive_failures`
   254	- **Recovery:** founder rotates CV-Library credentials
   255	
   256	#### `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH`
   257	- **Severity:** **blocking** — Sourcing Scout enters degraded mode (no profile fetches; cached only)
   258	- **Trigger:** LinkedIn session cookie / OAuth token revoked or expired (LinkedIn has aggressive anti-bot session invalidation)
   259	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   260	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   261	- **Payload fields:** `failure_type` (`session_expired` | `bot_detected_999` | `revoked_401`), `last_attempt_at`
   262	- **Recovery:** founder reauthenticates LinkedIn via Sourcing Scout admin flow
   263	
   264	#### `ESC_GMAIL_AUTH`
   265	- **Severity:** **blocking** — Concierge cannot send candidate emails; falls back to draft-only
   372	- **Note:** Operator review of sampled rows is asynchronous (typically end-of-day batch); no SLA timer.
   373	
   374	### 2.10 — Agent workflow (10 codes)
   375	Source: v1.0 agent.md draft specs across Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Cash Conductor, Concierge
   376	
   377	#### `ESC_GATE_B_MISS`
   378	- **Severity:** warn — post-send quality signal; not a hard failure
   379	- **Trigger:** Agent's local Gate B metric thresholds missed for the per-agent window (e.g. Janitor dedup confidence <15% AND field-completeness uplift <10%; Diagnostic <30% discovery-call conversion rate; etc — see each agent.md §5)
   380	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   381	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   382	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `metric_name`, `actual_value`, `threshold`, `window`, `sample_size`
   383	- **Note:** Local Gate B is a leading metric for agent quality; consecutive misses inform per-agent quality review. Not tied to a kill-criterion trigger in v1.0 (per disagreement-doc Cat-3 disposition).
   384	
   385	#### `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION`
   386	- **Severity:** warn — voice/tone classifier flagged output as violating a tenant `tone_rule` row
   387	- **Trigger:** Output drafted by an agent matches a tenant-defined `tone_rule` violation pattern (e.g. tenant prohibits "absolutely" in customer-facing comms; output contained it)
   388	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   389	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   390	- **Payload fields:** `tone_rule_id`, `pattern_violated`, `output_snippet_redacted`, `agent_name`, `tenant_slug`
   391	- **Recovery:** agent re-drafts with violation removed; if persistent, escalates to tone_rule review
   392	
   393	#### `ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE`
   394	- **Severity:** warn
   395	- **Trigger:** Field extraction (Janitor backfill / Scribe call-summary / Sourcing CV-parse) returned confidence below per-field threshold (default 0.7); writing the field would risk bad data
   396	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   397	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   398	- **Payload fields:** `entity_type`, `field_name`, `extracted_value`, `confidence_score`, `source` (e.g. `companies-house`, `linkedin`, `cv-pdf`), `agent_name`
   399	
   400	#### `ESC_CANDIDATE_DATA_INCOMPLETE`
   401	- **Severity:** warn
   402	- **Trigger:** Sourcing Scout candidate record lacks ≥N required fields for a shortlist (e.g. no email AND no phone, OR no LinkedIn AND no CV)
   403	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   404	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   405	- **Payload fields:** `candidate_id`, `missing_fields` (list), `shortlist_id`, `brief_id`
   406	
   407	#### `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH`
   408	- **Severity:** **blocking** — outbound send refused (whichever agent firing)
   409	- **Trigger:** Outbound recipient resolution failed — addressee does not match the entity whose lifecycle/event triggered the send. Two canonical use cases:
   410	  - **Cash Conductor:** chase/reminder/invoice addressee does not match Bullhorn placement client OR Xero contact (cross-system reconciliation failure between accounting + ATS)
   411	  - **Concierge:** lifecycle-event email recipient does not match the candidate_id whose state is changing (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim "no candidates emailed under another's name")
   412	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   413	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id`
   414	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `mismatch_class` (one of `cash_conductor_xero_bullhorn` | `concierge_candidate_email` | future variant), plus class-specific fields: Cash Conductor → `bullhorn_client_id`, `xero_contact_id`, `xero_contact_name`, `bullhorn_client_name`, `invoice_id`, `mismatch_dimension` (e.g. `name`, `email`, `address`); Concierge → `expected_candidate_bullhorn_id`, `actual_recipient_email`, `event_type`
   415	- **Recovery:** operator reviews; either reconciles manually OR updates one system to match
   416	
   417	#### `ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS`
   418	- **Severity:** warn — Cash Conductor cannot confidently match incoming payment to a specific invoice
   419	- **Trigger:** Bank-feed payment line cannot be matched to a single Xero invoice; multiple candidates within tolerance
   420	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   421	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   422	- **Payload fields:** `payment_id`, `amount`, `payee_name_raw`, `candidate_invoice_ids` (list), `match_basis` (e.g. `amount_only`, `payee_partial`)
   423	
   424	#### `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT`
   425	- **Severity:** **blocking** — outbound (email / SMS / call) refused
   426	- **Trigger:** Outbound recipient matches tenant's Do-Not-Contact list (loaded from tenant_adapters config); attempted send refused before transport
   427	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   428	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   429	- **Payload fields:** `recipient_id_hash`, `dnc_list_source`, `dnc_match_reason` (e.g. `explicit_opt_out`, `previous_complaint`, `gdpr_objection`), `action_type_attempted`

   592	
   593	| # | Agent | Weeks | Key dependency | Why this order |
   594	|---|---|---|---|---|
   595	| 1 | Diagnostic | 3–4 | LinkedIn + Companies House + scrape | Sales tool — needed before any other agent matters |
   596	| 2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals |
   597	| 3 | Scribe | 6 | Fathom/Fireflies MCP + Bullhorn W | Post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 min — second-most-demoable |
   598	| 4 | Cash Conductor | 7–8 | Xero + Open Banking | FD-tier closer; "DSO drops by 15 days" |
   599	| 5 | Sourcing Scout (daytime) | 9 | LinkedIn + Reed + CV-Library | First daytime always-on agent |
   600	| 6 | Concierge | 10–13 | Bullhorn + MS Graph + AgentMail | First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build |
   601	
   602	After Concierge ships, week 14 milestone: first pilot converts to paid.
   603	
   604	**Do not build out of order.** Diagnostic before Janitor (no Bullhorn dependency). Janitor before Scribe (batch easier than webhook-driven). Cash Conductor at week 7–8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume).

   563	    rationale: |
   564	      All v1.0 agents that produce voice-classified output (Diagnostic for

   566	      Conductor for chase drafts; Sourcing Scout for per-candidate
   567	      rationale) read voice_corpus for ANN-match exemplars. v0.2 only

   573	    rationale: |
   574	      Janitor agent.md §7 calls hh_load_tone_rules filtered by
   575	      applies_to_agents containing 'janitor' for tacit-note narrative
   576	      voice-classification. Per Round-8 Cat-β finding for Janitor.
   577	      Diagnostic + Sourcing Scout also read tone_rules for their
   578	      voice-classified outputs (§12 opener, per-candidate rationale).
   579	
   580	  recent_edit:
   581	    v0_2_v1_0_agent_access: [voice-drift-canary (W), Concierge (R), LoRA (R)]

   585	      - LoRA (R)                 # v0.2 unchanged
   586	      - Janitor (R)              # v0.3 NEW — tacit-note harvest per §4 Step 8
   587	      - Scribe (W)               # v0.3 NEW — writes own edits for retraining
   588	      - Cash Conductor (W)       # v0.3 NEW — writes own chase-draft edits
   589	      - Sourcing Scout (W)       # v0.3 NEW — writes own rationale edits
   590	    rationale: |
   591	      v0.2 only granted W to voice-drift-canary. v0.3 expands W to Scribe,
   592	      Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout (each writes its own recent_edit rows
   593	      for retraining queue). Janitor adds R for tacit-note harvest per
   594	      §4 Step 8. The v0.2 supplement file remains unchanged; this v0.3
   595	      supplement is the authoritative source for the expanded access list.

   352	| Policy file `autosend-policy.yaml` corrupted (YAML parse error) | First `hh_decision_action` call returns parse error | Fail-safe red for ALL actions; `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED` per action; agent halts | IFOS oncall restores from git history; renderer re-deploys; agent resumes |
   353	| Policy file references undefined tier | Tier dispatch hits `*)` default | `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED` with `lookup_error='unknown_tier:<value>'` | Policy file fixed; Codex ratifies; redeploy |
   354	| Tenant config (`tenant_adapters` row) corrupted or missing for `adapter_name='autosend_policy'` | `autosend_apply_tenant_override` returns non-zero | Use policy defaults (no override); log warning to `decision_log.payload.override_applied='none-tenant_config_missing'`; continue | Tenant config repaired; agent picks up override on next session |
   355	| `decision_log` table unreachable (Postgres down, RLS context unset, network partition) | INSERT raises error | **Hard blocking error**; agent halts entirely with non-zero exit; no actions taken at all | Postgres restored OR session restarted with valid context; agent resumes from last checkpoint |
   356	| Approval gate timeout (orange action) | `autosend_await_approval` returns timeout | Action auto-rejected with `payload.approval_status='timeout_rejected'`; agent receives non-zero from `hh_decision_action`; agent must abort or take alternate path | Operator may approve retroactively via Brain UI; new action_type variant fires (not auto-resumed) |
   357	| Telegram primitive 5 unavailable (bot down, chat_id invalid) | `autosend_escalate` returns non-zero | Decision_log row still written; orange action falls back to **block-with-pending** state; agent halts at the action | IFOS oncall investigates Telegram primitive; once restored, pending approval gates resume |
   358	| Action_type declared in `tools.yaml` but missing from `autosend-policy.yaml` | Renderer pre-flight validation per ADR-003 §4 | `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` with `reason='bundle-malformed'`; render aborts before agent deploys | Add `action_type` to policy file; Codex ratifies; re-render |

     1	# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing
     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed (2026-05-24 pre-W9-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice + tenant_adapters.config v0.4-supplement adding blocked_recipients + auto_source_on_brief_create).
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-24.
     5	**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
     6	**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
     7	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
     8	**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

    12	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    13	
    14	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    15	
    16	> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button, Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`), OR webhook from a "new brief" event in Bullhorn (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547). Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

    20	## §2 — Invocation surface
    21	
    22	### Brain UI (v1.0 primary)
    23	
    24	Brain UI v1.0 "Source candidates" button on any brief detail page → POST internal API → Sourcing Scout webhook.
    25	
    26	### Telegram command (v1.0)
    27	
    28	```
    29	@ifos_bot scout <brief-id-or-slug>
    30	@ifos_bot scout --description "Senior React engineer, London, £120k, hybrid"
    31	```
    32	
    33	### Webhook (v1.0)
    34	
    35	Bullhorn "new brief created" webhook → routed via internal bus → Sourcing Scout if tenant config enables `auto_source_on_brief_create` (v0.4-supplement-pending tenant_adapters.config key; v0.3 schema does NOT register this key — webhook-trigger code path is blocked until v0.4 supplement lands).
    36	
    37	### CLI (v1.0 — debugging)
    38	
    39	```bash
    40	ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --brief-id <id>
    41	ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --description "<free-text>"
    42	```
    43	
    44	### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)
    45	
    46	- Night Sourcer Tier-1 always-on (Brain UI dashboard; cortextOS primitive #6)
    47	- Bulk-source mode (`--brief-list briefs.csv`)
    48	- Refresh-source mode (re-source against the same brief 30 days later)

   102	## §4 — Workflow
   103	
   104	11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
   105	
   106	```
   107	0. Session start
   108	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
   109	     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` (Postgres-
   110	     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
   111	     registered config key)
   112	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")
   113	
   114	1. Brief ingestion
   115	   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   116	   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
   117	     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   118	   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
   119	     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   120	   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
   121	     "key_dims:<N>")
   122	
   123	2. Multi-source auth refresh
   124	   → bullhorn (read-only); LinkedIn/Proxycurl; Reed; CV-Library
   125	   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
   126	     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
   127	     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
   128	       enters degraded mode per catalogue ("drafts-only, no auto-send" —
   129	       Sourcing-Scout-specific interpretation: skip Bullhorn source +
   130	       continue with other 3 sources, since Sourcing Scout has no
   131	       auto-send path of its own; the "drafts-only" framing maps to
   132	       "report-only with Bullhorn data omitted from the sourcing set")
   133	     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
   134	       (Sourcing Scout: cached LinkedIn search only; live profile fetches
   135	       skipped)
   136	     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
   137	       Reed search results only)
   138	     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
   139	       (cached CV-Library search only)
   140	   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
   141	     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
   142	     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   143	   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
   144	     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>")
   145	
   146	3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   147	   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
   148	     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
   149	     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
   150	     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
   151	     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
   152	     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
   153	     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
   154	     modification recency within the active set.
   155	   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   156	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   157	   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   158	
   159	4. LinkedIn search (via Proxycurl)
   160	   → proxycurl.search_people(query=brief_key_dimensions, location=brief_location,
   161	     industry=brief_sector)
   162	   → up to 30 profiles
   163	   → cache 1h per (query, location, sector) tuple
   164	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Proxycurl quota hit (payload.upstream='linkedin')
   165	   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   166	
   167	5. Reed query
   168	   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   169	   → up to 30 candidates
   170	   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
   171	     (payload.upstream='reed')
   172	   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   173	
   174	6. CV-Library query
   175	   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   176	   → up to 30 candidates
   177	   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
   178	     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   179	   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")
   180	
   181	7. Aggregate + dedupe
   182	   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   183	   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
   184	     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   185	   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + LinkedIn
   186	     match" if found in both)
   187	   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
   188	     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")
   189	
   190	8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   191	   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)`
   192	     (concept referenced by autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
   193	     `send_to_blocked_recipient` action_type + ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT catalogue
   194	     §2.10; the actual config-key SCHEMA registration is v0.4-supplement-
   195	     pending — v0.3 supplement §4 only registers cash_conductor_last_run +
   196	     concierge_last_poll + concierge_send_window. Production-readiness
   197	     gate: v0.4 supplement must land before Sourcing Scout's DNC filter
   198	     path runs against real pilot data. Postgres-backed per ADR-002
   199	     vault/Postgres split — NOT vault markdown.)
   200	   → remove any candidate matching any DNC identifier from the sourcing list
   201	   → log dropped candidates to exception list in §3 output
   202	   → NOTE: ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT is catalogue §2.10 reserved for OUTBOUND SEND
   203	     REFUSAL specifically. Sourcing Scout filters DNC matches AT SOURCING
   204	     TIME (pre-outbound); no outbound send attempt occurs. v0.3 disposition:
   205	     log DNC drops in exception list only; no ESC fire. W4-polish backlog:
   206	     add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER for the pre-outbound case.
   207	   → hh_decision_output("dnc_filter", "brief:<id>",
   208	     "dropped:<N>; kept:<N>")
   209	
   210	9. LLM ranking + rationale generation (per candidate)
   211	   → for top 15 by source-aggregated confidence: generate per-candidate
   212	     rationale ≥50 words
   213	   → prompt = (brief context + candidate profile + voice corpus + tone rules)
   214	   → voice classifier scores rationale (≥0.75)
   215	   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries; drop candidate
   216	     from final list
   217	   → hh_decision_output("candidate_proposed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id|external_ref>",
   218	     "source:<bullhorn|linkedin|reed|cvlibrary>; confidence:<N>; voice_score:<N>; included:<bool>") — emitted PER CANDIDATE per §3 contract (one row per candidate proposed; dropped candidates also get a row with included=false + drop_reason)
   219	
   220	10. Output assembly + Gate A validation
   221	    → ensure 5-15 candidates remaining after Step 9
   222	    → ensure each has working contact method (email validated via simple
   223	      regex + domain MX check; phone validated via E.164 format)
   224	    → ensure each rationale ≥50 words
   225	    → if any condition fails: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE (output-shape violation
   226	      per catalogue line 184 — distinct from ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION which is
   227	      reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time);
   228	      partial draft to /tmp; abort
   229	    → write Markdown report to vault path per §3
   230	    → hh_decision_output("scout_report", report_path, "N candidates from M sources")
   231	
   232	11. Session close + notification
   233	    → operator notification per invocation source (Brain UI: in-app
   234	      notification; Telegram: reply with report path; webhook: bus event back)
   235	    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
   236	      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
   237	    → exit code 0

   242	## §5 — Gates
   243	
   244	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   245	
   246	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):
   247	
   248	- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
   249	- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
   250	- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
   251	- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands)` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
   252	- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
   253	- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text → fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (BLOCKING per catalogue §2.5 lines 148-154; halts immediately, not warn-only output-shape)
   254	- No enabled live source returns 0 candidates WITHOUT a recorded degradation exception note (sources in degraded mode per §4 Step 2 are expected to return 0 and don't trip Gate A)
   255	
   256	Gate A failure routing by class:
   257	- PII leakage → `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (blocking; operator + ifos_oncall)
   258	- Output-shape failures (count not in 5-15, contact-method missing, rationale <50 words, voice classifier miss, all-source-failure-without-degradation) → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (warn; operator_chat_id)
   259	Draft to `/tmp`; operator review.

   261	**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.
   262	
   263	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   264	
   265	Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.
   266	
   267	Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply OR Bullhorn note. Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant.
   268	
   269	Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).
   270	
   271	Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

   275	## §6 — Escalation codes
   276	
   277	Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:
   278	
   279	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   280	|---|---|---|---|
   281	| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   282	| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | LinkedIn / Proxycurl session/OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   283	| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   284	| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
   285	| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / linkedin / reed / cv-library) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   286	| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   287	| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
   288	| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
   289	| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
   290	| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |
   291	
   292	Sourcing Scout does NOT use:
   293	
   294	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
   295	- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
   296	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
   297	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
   298	- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.
   299	
   300	---
   301	
   302	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   303	
   304	Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   305	
   306	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
   307	  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
   308	  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
   309	  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
   310	  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
   311	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
   312	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.
   313	
   314	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

   349	## §9 — Status + open questions
   350	
   351	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.
   352	
   353	### Open questions for founder review
   354	
   355	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   356	|---|---|---|
   357	| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
   358	| Q2 | Proxycurl pricing — ~$39/mo for 5,000 credits at low volume; scales with usage. Per pilot tenant budget? | ~5-10 briefs/day per consultant × 50 calls/brief = up to 2,500 credits/day per consultant. Cost: ~$20-50/day at peak. |
   359	| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (v0.4-supplement-pending — v0.3 §4 does not include this key; runs against pilot tenants blocked until v0.4 lands) (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
   360	| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
   361	| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback. Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet. Telegram reply? | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful". v1.1: Brain UI button. |
   362	| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
   363	| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |
   364	
   365	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)
   366	
   367	1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
   368	2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
   369	3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.

   373	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   374	
   375	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built 2026-05-24, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex review-agent-bundle returns RATIFIED verdict.
   376	
   377	Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
   378	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   379	- Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
   380	- Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
   381	- Q6: ADR-006 (source-abstraction layer) drafted + ratified
   382	
   383	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   384	- W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   385	- First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
   386	- Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram OR Brain UI)
   387	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill
   388	
   389	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.
   390	
   391	*End of Sourcing Scout agent.md draft.*

   128	## §4 — Integration with the `hh_decision_action` contract
   424	Tenants can elevate tier classification via the `tenant_adapters` table per Day 4 §6.3:
   425	
   426	```sql
   427	INSERT INTO tenant_adapters (tenant_slug, adapter_name, config, enabled)
   428	VALUES (
   429	  'acme-fintech',
   430	  'autosend_policy',
   431	  '{
   432	    "tier_overrides": {
   433	      "bullhorn_note_internal": "yellow",
   434	      "linkedin_connection_request": "orange",
   435	      "bullhorn_candidate_dedupe": "orange"
   436	    },
   437	    "blocked_recipients": [
   438	      "competitor-employees@*",
   439	      "specific.email@example.com"

   442	      "default_recipient": "<telegram-chat-id-from-secrets-env>",
   443	      "escalation_chain": ["operator", "owner"]
   444	    },
   459	### Override rules
   460	
   461	1. **Elevation only.** Tenants can move an action_type from green → yellow → orange → red. They cannot move it the other direction (red → orange, orange → yellow, yellow → green).
   462	2. **Red is absolute.** A red action_type cannot be elevated by tenant override (already at maximum) and cannot be relaxed (red is the floor).
   463	3. **`blocked_recipients`** is additive only. Recipients can be added; system-default red-list recipients cannot be removed. Pattern matching supported via `*` wildcards.
   464	4. **`approval_routing.default_recipient`** is required for any tenant with orange-tier actions enabled. Pointer to a Telegram chat ID (or other channel via tenant_adapters expansion). Sourced from `/vault/<tenant>/_secrets.env` at render time per ADR-003 Decision 3 §2.1.
   465	5. **`approval_timeouts`** allow per-action_type customisation within range [PT30M, PT72H]. Defaults to PT4H if unspecified.

1. DNC schema status is internally contradictory and source-inaccurate. Line 3 says v0.4 must add `blocked_recipients`; line 16 says v0.3 lacks it; lines 109-111 call the same key “canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3 registered”; line 359 says “already-registered” while still saying v0.4-pending. Verified sources conflict with the artefact’s claim: `docs/verticals/recruitment/migrations/v0.2-to-v0.3.sql` allowlists `blocked_recipients`, while `vertical-schema.v0.3-supplement.yaml` §4 documents only three added keys. Fix by making one canonical statement: either add the missing schema supplement entry before use, or cite the existing autosend/migration source and remove all v0.4-pending language for `blocked_recipients`.

2. Gate B feedback via Bullhorn note contradicts the bundle’s read-only Bullhorn contract. Line 267 says consultant feedback may be captured via “Bullhorn note,” but lines 281-295 frame Bullhorn as auth/read-only and explicitly exclude `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL`. A Bullhorn note is a write path and would need tools.yaml capability, autosend/decision logging, and failure routing. Fix by removing Bullhorn note from v1.0 Gate B measurement, or declare a Bullhorn write capability with matching gates and ESC handling.

3. §8 build-start prerequisites are circular. Lines 320 and 345 say the W9 build cannot start until all listed dependencies are ✅, but lines 340-343 list `validate.sh`, `context.sh`, `cycle.sh`, and fixtures as “Build at W9 start.” That makes outputs of the W9 slice prerequisites for starting the W9 slice, weakening the status signal. Fix by splitting true pre-build prerequisites from W9 deliverables/status-flip criteria.
