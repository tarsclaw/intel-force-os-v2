=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Janitor — the wedge agent

**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Cron (v1.0)

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)

```bash
ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
```

`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.

### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: CRNs, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | Composite score: (dedup % improvement × 0.5) + (field-completeness % improvement × 0.5). Target ≥12.5 (≥15% dedup + ≥10% field) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 |
| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |

### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)

Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):

1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` line 89, `client.size_employees` line 243, `contractor.day_rate_min`/`day_rate_max` lines 193-197, `brief.salary_min`/`salary_max` lines 371-376 from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill` (new — flagged for autosend-policy.yaml addition at W5 build with proposed tier=yellow + sample_rate=10)**.
3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_tag`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 35; green tier — note appends are non-customer-facing; metadata reversible).

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

---

## §4 — Workflow

12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")

1. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)

3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)

4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)

5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 89),
     client.industry (line 252), client.size_employees (line 243),
     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   → identify missing-field rows
   → batch enrichment calls
   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")

6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   → companies_house.search(client.legal_name) → CRN → profile → fill industry +
     registered_office_address + sic_codes
   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429

7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
     signup commercial decision)
   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
     current_company → write back

8. Tacit-note harvest
   → query decision_log for recent_edit rows in last 30 days for this tenant
     where resolution='approved_after_edit'
   → group by target_entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)

9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff

10. Day-30 report assembly
   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")

11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")

12. Session close
   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → exit code 0 (or 1 if Gate-B missed for 3 consecutive runs → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)

Gate A failures fire `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` + draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.

Composite score = (dedup% × 0.5) + (field-completeness% × 0.5). Target ≥12.5.

Gate B doesn't block the agent. It's the v1.0 kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 supporting metric ("Gate-B revenue uplift" — Janitor's day-30 report is THE artefact that demonstrates "DSO drops" / "consultant time saved" claims to the FD-tier closer).

Below ≥12.5 for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

**Note:** Codes marked `(new)` in the table below are flagged for addition to `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` at this agent's W5 build slice per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern. Existing codes match `escalation-codes.md` definitions verbatim.

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` (existing, line 97) | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` (existing, line 156) | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` (existing, line 120) | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` (existing, line 148) | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (existing Day-19, line 184) | Gate A failure (section count or per-section citation missing in day-30 report) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_DUPLICATE_DETECTED` (existing, line 127) | Merge proposal rejected at validate.sh: confidence below threshold OR activity-window block | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` (new — W5 catalogue add) | Composite Gate-B score <12.5 for 3 consecutive runs | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_YELLOW_SPOT_CHECK` (new — W5 catalogue add; could alternatively map to existing `ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW` line 33) | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Janitor does NOT use:

- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)

Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)

1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill: this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

Diagnostic bundle does not yet exist (gated on Q1 design partner LOI per Risk #3). When Diagnostic first renders cleanly at W4, severity drops to Medium. Three implementation deviations flagged for ADR-004 ratification: (a) CLI-name divergence (`ifos-render-agent` standalone vs `cortextos-ifos render-agent` per ADR-003 §3.3.1; submodule read-only boundary prevents the latter); (b) `_shared/` symlink target counting error in ADR-003 §3.3.3 (spec says `../../_shared`, correct is `../../../_shared` — 3 vs 4 levels); (c) phantom `_shared` listing in upstream `cortextos-ifos list-agents` (renderer correctness unaffected; cosmetic). **Owner:** Claude Code Day 8 commit chain shipped; founder for Diagnostic-build green-light when Q1 turns YES. |

agents/_shared/README.md:177:- `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` — full tier model + §4 reference impl
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:17:> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) consultant-approved orange-tier payment-chase email drafts queued to Concierge for send (Concierge handles the actual send; Cash Conductor only drafts), and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 §5.1: this independence is its strategic value when Bullhorn paths are delayed). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are orange-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (consultant approval required before send via Concierge); reconciliation writes are yellow-tier.
agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md:90:For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. Output is a queued draft, NOT a send. Drafts route to Concierge (which handles the actual send pipeline + consultant approval per autosend §4 orange tier).

Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:67:Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:69:1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim).

docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md:303:- **§1 Output contract:** nightly cleanup sweep across pilot tenant's Bullhorn data. Writes (a) day-30 before/after report Markdown to `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`; (b) field-level Bullhorn writes (deduplication, field completeness fixes, tacit-note attachment). All writes Tier 1 yellow per autosend-safety-policy.
docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md:305:- **§4 Workflow:** ~12 steps. Cron 02:00 UTC daily. Bullhorn auth refresh → entity scan → dedup pass → field completeness pass → tacit-note attach → Bullhorn writes (yellow tier; spot-check sampling per autosend §4) → report assembly → vault write → operator Telegram notify.

docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md:423:- **§3 Output shape:** message drafts (email / Bullhorn note customer-visible / SMS as configured); decision-log audit row per send; orange-tier spot-check sampling at 1-in-N rate per autosend-safety-policy §4.
docs/operations/goal-week-3-polish-and-scaffold.md:424:- **§4 Workflow:** ~15 steps. Bullhorn poll every 5 min → detect state transition → fetch context (candidate + client + placement entities) → identify message template → LLM draft → voice classifier ≥0.75 → tone-rule check → tier classification → autosend bridge call (per D1 decision) → audit row.

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:8:**Path drift logged:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 specifies `docs/v1-kill-criterion.md` (docs/ root). This artefact lives at `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` per repo convention. Recorded as **Edit 10** in atomic-correction manifest (shared with autosend-safety-policy.md path drift).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:107:### Trigger 5 — AUTOSEND-RED-MISCATEGORISATIONS (PAUSE)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:109:**Threshold:** More than 3 confirmed red-tier autosend breaches per pilot per week from actions that should have been classified as green or yellow. "Confirmed" means: tenant operator files a `false-block` feedback report via Brain UI (or equivalent v1.0 manual channel) AND IFOS oncall agrees the tier classification was wrong. Threshold measured per individual pilot over rolling 7-day windows.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:113:**Source:** `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §5 + §10; Risk #3 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (LUKS manual unlock has higher impact but autosend miscategorisation has higher frequency).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:117:**Escalation path:** If three pilots experience this trigger within one quarter, escalate to system-wide PAUSE while structural autosend policy redesign happens (potential v1.1 advancement of orange tier).
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:188:**Threshold:** ANY confirmed incident in which agent action results in PII (personally-identifiable information per UK GDPR Art. 4(1)) transmitted to an unauthorised party (cross-tenant recipient, unauthorised external recipient, or recipient outside tenant's declared data residency) AND not blocked by the RLS + autosend policy combination.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:196:**Action:** KILL. Rationale: multi-tenant trust is the structural foundation of v1.0. A single confirmed PII breach beyond the RLS + autosend boundary indicates the foundation is unsound. Continuing operation risks (a) further breaches, (b) regulatory action, (c) catastrophic loss of pilot trust. Wind-down protects existing pilots from further exposure.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:235:**Must-fill before first pilot LOI signs.** The pilot agreement may reference an external advisor for dispute resolution per `autosend-safety-policy.md` §10 placeholder language. Founder identifies and engages within Weeks 1-2.

docs/runbooks/operational-hygiene-protocol.md:268:**Root cause:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 invented "master brief §10.4 cost target" during drafting. The citation propagated through Day-5 kill criterion (3 instances), Day-5 autosend policy (1 instance), RISK-REGISTER (2 instances), current-priorities (1 instance) by trusting the Day-4 runbook citation rather than re-verifying against master brief. Citation transitivity, not master-brief drift.

Verified §4.1 establishes the action exists but does not explicitly frame as sensitive auto-send. Sensitivity framing lives in §6.3 ("Note creation is the most sensitive auto-send because notes are immediately visible to clients and candidates in the Bullhorn UI").

agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md:16:> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Drafts are orange-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` — consultant approval required before send via the autosend-bridge mechanism (Founder Decision D1 path A bridge OR D1-B shim OR D1-C manual; W10 design selects). Sends route via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; AgentMail deferred to v1.1+). Gate A hard-fails any draft generated >30 minutes after lifecycle event, any draft with voice classifier <0.75, or any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). Gate B success threshold: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

NO Bullhorn dependency — Cash Conductor operates entirely against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack, making it the most-independent v1.0 agent (per ADR-005 §5.1: this independence is its strategic value when Bullhorn paths are delayed). Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540) — the FD-tier closer metric.

docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:20:**Counter:** Codex is applying the Day-7 single-sentence-test Q3 quality gate ("ATS decided + auth cleared") as if it were a Week-1 implementation gate. The Q3 gate is correct as a closing-of-Week-0 gate per master brief §6 line 502, and Q3 = NO is exactly why Week 0 EXTENDS per the Day-7 single-sentence-test result. But the Q3 gate governs **named v1.0 agent-build slices** (Diagnostic W3-4, Janitor W5, etc.), NOT Week-1 prerequisite code.
docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-bullhorn-week-1-gate.md:31:Specifically: per `sequencing-target.md` §2.1 line 96, Diagnostic (the first agent build, W3-4) is explicitly "no Bullhorn; Tier 2 (request-driven, no persistent PTY)." Per ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1, Diagnostic's MCP tools are "Companies House, LinkedIn (read-only), web scraper for careers pages" — no Bullhorn. **Diagnostic W3-4 build does not touch the Bullhorn auth path at all.**

docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:73:### Trigger 3 — JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5 (PIVOT)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:75:**Threshold:** Janitor agent cannot authenticate to Bullhorn via the documented OAuth flow (per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.5 refresh-loop architecture) by end of Week 5 (2026-06-28). Authentication failure modes that trigger: (a) OAuth token endpoint returns non-2xx persistently; (b) refresh-loop architecture fails at 10-minute TTL boundary; (c) Bullhorn rate-limits IFOS's auth endpoint preventing pilot operations; (d) Bullhorn partnership programme requirement blocks production-tenant access.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:85:- **Option C:** ATS-agnostic with manual data sync. Reduces v1.0 to read-only agent operation against ATS export files; loses much of the Janitor + Concierge value but unblocks pilot acquisition.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:93:**Threshold:** Two instances of "scope cut" activations during v1.0 build. A scope cut is defined as **any founder-approved reduction from the ratified 6-agent v1.0 fleet** (Diagnostic, Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge per master brief §8.2). Examples that count as one activation: 6→5, 6→4, 6→3. The Risk #4 contingency (6→4 for solo-founder mitigation) counts as one activation; any *further* reduction triggers PAUSE.
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:158:### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md:227:- **Trigger 8 (Gate-B revenue) KILL:** founder decides KILL on revenue evidence; consults Jack on wind-down terms with existing pilots before 30-day notice goes out.

Diagnostic (W3-4) faces Trigger 2; Janitor (W5) faces Trigger 3; all agents from W3 onward face Triggers 5, 6, 9. The kill criterion is the operational definition of "are we still on-track" at each weekly review.

docs/architecture/vault-concurrency.md:185:The flock (§2) prevents two operations from racing the same file's read-then-write. The Postgres version check (§3) catches the rare case where flock acquisition succeeded sequentially but a *different* code path (e.g. cron-driven full-table update in Janitor's nightly sweep) updated the row without holding flock.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:145:| `heartbeat` | cortextOS heartbeat cadence — periodic `update-heartbeat` writes to `${ctxRoot}/heartbeats/{name}.json` so the dashboard sees "alive" status | IFOS agents emit heartbeats too (the daemon's fast-checker writes them per `agent-process.ts:597-639` session timer), but the *cadence* and *what the agent does at each heartbeat* is specced per-agent in `agent.md` (Concierge always-on; Janitor cron-driven; etc.). The cortextOS-template `heartbeat/SKILL.md` is a default playbook — IFOS replaces with per-agent specifics |
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:165:Concierge is the Tier-1 always-on candidate-lifecycle agent per master brief §8.2 A6 and Product Spec §2.2 R7. v1.0 build weeks 10-13. First user of the rendered output is the renderer's own integration test; production first-user is the first paid pilot in Q3 2026.
docs/architecture/agent-bundle-renderer-design.md:767:**First production render:** the Diagnostic agent (master brief §8.2 A1) at Week 4 — this is also the first end-to-end proof that the renderer works against a real bundle. Subsequent renders for Janitor (Week 5), Scribe (Week 6), Cash Conductor (Weeks 7-8), Sourcing Scout (Week 9), and Concierge (Weeks 10-13) extend the validation surface.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §8.2 (the build-order table) + Ultraplan §9 (the existing 14-week sprint plan) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md` §4.1 + §6 for the Bullhorn-dependency carry-forward; then `docs/decisions/ADR-003-agent-bundle-renderer.md` §5.2 for the renderer's Week-1-prerequisite role.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:17:Master brief §8.2 (lines 597-611) names six v1.0 agents and assigns build weeks:

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:22:| A2 | Janitor | 5 | Bullhorn MCP (R+W) | "First demoable inside-ATS result; day-30 before/after closes deals" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:24:| A4 | Cash Conductor | 7-8 | Xero + Open Banking | "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:28:Master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 asks the Day-3 decision document to "confirm or revise" the Ultraplan §9 sequence. Ultraplan §9 (lines 717-801) carries the same six-agent order: Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → Cash Conductor → Sourcing Scout → Concierge.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:34:- **C. Gating criteria between agents.** What "Janitor ready, move to Scribe" means concretely. Avoids the trap of "kinda-working" agents accumulating with no measurable transition discipline.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:44:**Gating criteria prevent the agent-pile-up failure mode.** Without §C, the temptation is "Janitor is 80% working, let's start Scribe alongside while we polish Janitor." That sounds reasonable and is the wrong move — it splits attention, blocks Codex ratification (master brief §10.5 names every `agent.md` as always-ratify, which can't happen until the bundle is stable), and accumulates half-finished agents that all need rework before any can land in a tenant. Explicit gating criteria force serial transitions.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:55:| 2 | **Substrate exercise** | Fraction of Week-1-2 substrate (renderer / `_shared/voice-loader.sh` / `_shared/hook-helpers.sh` / Postgres `decision_log` / `_secrets.env` / Bullhorn auth refresh-loop) the agent exercises | Higher substrate exercise = more value as smoke test for the substrate, but also higher risk of substrate-bug-attributed-to-agent confusion |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:56:| 3 | **Risk de-risking** | Which named risks the agent's success/failure surfaces — Risk #1 (cortextOS primitives), Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth), Risk #5 (renderer-not-built) — per `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` | Building risk-surfacing agents earlier converts known-unknowns into known-knowns; building risk-deferring agents earlier preserves optionality but pushes the surprise window later |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:67:> "v1.0 scope cut from 6 agents to 4 (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout to v1.1); Maddox solo through end of v1.0" (master brief §12 Risk #4 row + Ultraplan §10 row #4 + Ultraplan §10 row #2 contingency "defer Janitor & Scribe to weeks 7-8, push Concierge to v1.1").
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:71:- **If Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) materialises** — defer Janitor + Scribe to weeks 7-8 (slip the Bullhorn-dependent agents by 2 weeks); push Concierge to v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:74:Recommended sequence in §4 must remain **operationally coherent under both contingencies.** A sequence that breaks (e.g. one that ships Concierge before Janitor) would lose the Risk #2 contingency because dropping Janitor would orphan the already-shipped Concierge's data flow. The §4 recommendation explicitly validates against both contingencies.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:76:The recommended sequence in §4 assumes v1.0 ships all six agents on the master brief §8.2 timeline. The scope-cut contingency activates on **Week 5 burn-down review** if Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) or Hire #1 status (Risk #4) tripwires fire.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:80:Master brief §8.2 (line 605) and Ultraplan §9 (line 771-773) both place **Cash Conductor at Weeks 7-8 and Sourcing Scout at Week 9** — i.e. Cash Conductor before Sourcing Scout. The founder's Day-3 prompt for this document named "Option Alpha" as Diagnostic → Janitor → Scribe → **Sourcing Scout (W8) → Cash Conductor (W9)** → Concierge — i.e. Sourcing Scout *before* Cash Conductor. This is a minor divergence from the operative master brief.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:82:Per master brief §0 ("the master brief wins on every point of conflict"), the canonical sequence per master brief §8.2 places Cash Conductor at W7-8 before Sourcing Scout at W9. The Ultraplan §9 rationale (line 766) explicitly anchors this to Hire #1 onboarding: "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7 (verify, don't assume)" — Cash Conductor's Xero MCP + Open Banking integration is the right work for a new hire's first sprint per Ultraplan §9 line 766.

Janitor must ship before its dependents | High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:114:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn `client_id` + `client_secret` (commercial action per Day 2 §6.1) + per-tenant Bullhorn admin OAuth authorisation (the browser dance per Day 2 §3.1). First-pilot onboarding wizard Day 2 step (Product Spec §5.2) is the moment Janitor can be enabled per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:116:**Readiness summary:** Janitor — second-most-important first agent after Diagnostic; first Bullhorn auth exercise (Risk #2 derisk); high commercial value via day-30 cleanup report per Product Spec §2.2 R9; downstream dependents (Scribe / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) inherit its Bullhorn pattern; ready Week 5 per master brief §8.2 line 602.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:123:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium-High** | Exercises Bullhorn W (smaller surface than Janitor's R+W). First agent with external webhook trigger (Fathom / Fireflies). First exercise of voice-loader for **tacit-note tone-detection** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 523. Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth refresh-loop |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:124:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Medium** | Reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth path (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Surfaces new failure mode: **webhook-arrival-to-Bullhorn-write SLA** (5-min target per Ultraplan §8.1 line 521). Doesn't directly touch Risk #5 (renderer already proven by Diagnostic) or Risk #1 (still Tier 2) |

Scribe must ship before Concierge | Medium-High criticality |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:127:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Fathom or Fireflies OAuth + Bullhorn (already onboarded if Janitor shipped). Tacit-note taxonomy needs per-firm calibration in first 30 days of production per Ultraplan §8.1 line 527 |

Substrate exercise | **High** | **First Tier-1 always-on agent** — exercises cortextOS **Primitive 1** (persistent PTY/PM2, flagged "shipped but flaky" in cortextos-primitive-status.md). First exercise of **Primitive 4** (approval gates) for chase email auto-send per master brief §8.2 line 604. First exercise of **Primitive 5** (Telegram approval surface) for FD-tier approval flow. **Does NOT touch Bullhorn** — independent integration path per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §1.2 (Cash Conductor uses Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking, not Bullhorn) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:138:| 4. Commercial value | **High** | Per master brief §8.2 line 604: "FD-tier closer; 'DSO drops by 15 days'." Product Spec §2.2 R2: £40-120k working capital unlock per agency, "one bad debt caught per quarter pays for the entire suite" |

Dependencies | **Upstream:** none on other agents (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking infra independent of Bullhorn path). **Downstream:** none in v1.0 (Cash Conductor's outputs are tenant-internal chase emails + DSO reports, not consumed by other v1.0 agents) | Low cross-agent coupling |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:144:**Readiness summary:** Cash Conductor — first Tier-1 always-on agent (Risk #1 first exercise: cortextOS Primitives 1+4+5); Hire-#1-anchored W7-8 per Ultraplan §9 line 766; independent of Bullhorn (no shared substrate with Janitor/Scribe path); ready Weeks 7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 604.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:151:| 2. Substrate exercise | **Medium** | Reuses Bullhorn R from Janitor (no new Bullhorn substrate). New MCP integrations: LinkedIn via Proxycurl (rate-limited per Ultraplan §10 row #6), Reed, CV-Library.

Risk de-risking | **Medium** | **First exercise of LinkedIn rate-limit budget** per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6 ("LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected"). Reuses Bullhorn auth from Janitor (doesn't re-derisk Risk #2). Tier 2 so doesn't touch Risk #1 primitives |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:153:| 4. Commercial value | **Medium** | Per Product Spec §2.2 R5: "Shortlist in 15 minutes instead of by end of week." Less commercially load-bearing than Janitor/Scribe/Concierge — request-response not always-on, so less of a closing-demo asset. Sales narrative is "cuts intake-call-to-first-shortlist time from same-week to same-hour" |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:154:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor's Bullhorn auth pattern. **Downstream:** Night Sourcer (v1.1) reuses Sourcing Scout's multi-source layer per Ultraplan §8.1 line 555 ("Build the source-abstraction layer carefully — Night Sourcer in v1.1 will reuse it") | Medium criticality (v1.1 downstream) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:155:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Medium** | Needs Bullhorn (already on if Janitor shipped) + LinkedIn (Proxycurl API key — single application-level key, not per-tenant) + Reed OAuth + CV-Library OAuth per tenant |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:157:**Readiness summary:** Sourcing Scout — multi-source request-response agent; reuses Janitor's Bullhorn auth; first LinkedIn rate-limit exercise (Risk #6 surfacing); designed for Night Sourcer v1.1 reuse; ready Week 9 per master brief §8.2 line 605.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:166:| 4. Commercial value | **Highest** | Per master brief §8.2 line 606: "First Tier-1 always-on closing demo; 4-week build." Product Spec §2.2 R7: 15-25% lift in placement-driven referral revenue ("post-placement nurture is the cheapest BD channel in recruitment and you currently leave it on the table"). The flagship v1.0 closing demo |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:167:| 5. Dependencies | **Upstream:** Janitor (Bullhorn auth pattern), Scribe (Notes for context). **Downstream:** Triage (v1.1) hands off candidates to Concierge per master brief §8.2 line 606 + Ultraplan §8.2 line 578. Concierge MUST ship after Janitor + Scribe | Highest cross-agent dependency |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:170:**Readiness summary:** Concierge — biggest v1.0 build (XL/4 weeks), flagship closing demo per master brief §8.2 line 606; first Primitive-2 exercise (71h context rotation); depends on Janitor + Scribe for Bullhorn auth + voice substrate already in place; ready Weeks 10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 606 / Ultraplan §9 line 774.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:176:Three orderings evaluated against §1.3 criteria. **Option Alpha is the master-brief §8.2 canonical sequence** (correcting the §1.5 founder-prompt drift); Options Beta and Gamma are tested as alternatives.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:178:### 3.1 — Option Alpha (canonical, master-brief §8.2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:182:W5:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:189:**Why this ordering:** Diagnostic-first de-risks the substrate end-to-end (renderer + `_shared/` + decision_log) before any production-critical agent. Janitor second exercises Bullhorn auth (Risk #2) and establishes the auth-refresh-loop pattern that three downstream agents inherit. Scribe third reuses Janitor's Bullhorn path and adds voice-loader-for-tacit-notes — the voice substrate every later agent depends on. Cash Conductor at W7-8 is independent of the Bullhorn track (Xero/QuickBooks/Sage + Open Banking) AND first-exercises cortextOS Tier-1 Primitives 1+4+5 (Risk #1) — both make it Hire-#1-appropriate first work per Ultraplan §9 line 766. Sourcing Scout at W9 extends the multi-source pattern (LinkedIn rate-limit derisk per Risk #6). Concierge at W10-13 lands last with all dependencies (Bullhorn auth from Janitor; voice substrate from Scribe; Primitive 1 derisk from Cash Conductor; Primitive 2 first exercise its own).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:193:- W5: Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth) — Janitor first writes. Reduction trigger 2 fires (Medium → Low per `bullhorn-integration-path.md` §6.7).
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:208:W5-8: Concierge (A6) — front-load the flagship (XL/4 weeks)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:209:W9:   Janitor (A2)
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:219:1. **Concierge depends on Janitor** (Bullhorn auth pattern) and **Scribe** (voice substrate, Notes-for-context) per §2.6 row 5. Building Concierge at W5-8 before either dependency forces Janitor + Scribe primitives to be built inline within Concierge's bundle — XL build becomes 2XL.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:229:W5:   Janitor (A2) — Risk #2 derisk
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:241:2. **Concierge XL = 4 weeks** per Ultraplan §8.1 line 568. W6-9 is 4 weeks, but with W6 partially overlapping Janitor's W5 finish — realistic Concierge ship is W7-W10, conflicting with Cash Conductor's W11 slot AND with the Hire #1 W7 anchor.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:252:| 1. Implementation simplicity (smallest first) | **Wins** — Diagnostic (M) → Janitor (L) → Scribe (M) → Cash Conductor (L) → Sourcing Scout (L) → Concierge (XL): monotonically ascending until W10-13 | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W5-8 is largest agent second | Loses — Concierge (XL) at W6-9 likewise |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:253:| 2. Substrate exercise (sequential build-up) | **Wins** — each agent extends the substrate of the prior (renderer → Bullhorn auth → voice → Tier-1 primitives → multi-source → full Tier-1 lifecycle) | Loses — Concierge has to build its own Bullhorn auth + voice substrate inline | Loses — Concierge built before its substrate dependencies (Scribe's Notes-for-context not yet available) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:254:| 3. Risk de-risking | **Wins** — Risk #5 W4 (Diagnostic), Risk #2 W5 (Janitor), Risk #1 W7-8 (Cash Conductor) — three reduction triggers fire sequentially without coupling | Loses — Risk #1 pushed to W12-13 | Tied — Risk #1 W6-9 (Concierge), but coupled with Bullhorn substrate gaps |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:255:| 4. Commercial value | Tied (Diagnostic substrate, then flagship Concierge last; closing demo at W12-13 per Ultraplan §9 line 781) | Wins on raw timing (Concierge W5-8 demoable earlier) — but loses on substrate quality (Concierge ships with degraded Notes-for-context) | Tied — Concierge W6-9 marginally earlier than Alpha but with same substrate gaps as Beta |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:256:| 5. Dependencies on other agents | **Wins** — Janitor's Bullhorn auth → Scribe reuses → Sourcing Scout reuses → Concierge reuses, all in dependency order | Loses — Concierge before Janitor + Scribe breaks the upstream chain | Loses — Concierge before Scribe breaks the upstream chain |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:257:| 6. Tenant-onboarding readiness | **Wins** — Diagnostic deployable immediately (no Bullhorn); Janitor first-pilot wizard Day 2 enables Bullhorn track; Concierge last when all per-tenant config (voice corpus, nurture cadence) ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding hardest agent, demanded at W5-8 before pilot ready | Loses — Concierge tenant-onboarding demanded at W6-9 before pilot ready |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:266:| **Risk #2 materialises** → defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1 | **Coherent.** Diagnostic W3-4 stands; Janitor + Scribe slip W7-8; Cash Conductor takes the W5-6 slot; Sourcing Scout at W9; Concierge cut. Hire #1 onboards onto Janitor instead of Cash Conductor — same scope-of-difficulty | Incoherent. Concierge already at W5-8 — can't be cut without 4 weeks of wasted XL build. Risk #2 contingency activation forces Concierge rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge at W6-9 — same wasted-build problem |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:267:| **Risk #4 materialises (Hire #1 doesn't start)** → drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo | **Coherent.** Founder solo through W6-Scribe; W7-8 Cash Conductor becomes founder solo work (slows but doesn't block); Sourcing Scout + Concierge cut. v1.0 ships as 4 agents per Ultraplan §10 Risk #4 contingency | Incoherent. Concierge already W5-8 — can't be cut without rewrite | Incoherent. Concierge already W6-9 |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:275:**This section ratifies master brief §8.2 lines 597-611 + Ultraplan §9 lines 717-801 as the v1.0 sequence of record. Day 3's contribution is the §5 gating criteria + §4.3 named revisit conditions — not a new sequence proposal.** Master brief §8.2 already named the order; this document closes the "confirm or revise" decision per master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 as **confirm**.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:282:| 2 | W5 | **Janitor** (A2) | First Bullhorn auth + downstream-pattern-setter (Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge inherit) |
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:292:Per §3.4 comparison table: Alpha wins 6/6 criteria (5 outright + 1 tied). Per §3.5 contingency-coherence: Alpha is the only sequence that survives **both documented contingency paths** from §1.4 cleanly — Risk #2 materialises (defer Janitor + Scribe to W7-8, push Concierge to v1.1) and Risk #4 materialises (drop Concierge + Sourcing Scout, founder solo). Options Beta and Gamma each force a Concierge rewrite if their respective trigger fires per §3.5.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:304:- **Updates required:** `.agents/current-priorities.md` open list; this document's §4.1 table; master brief §8.2 (atomic correction commit edit, joining the 7-edit manifest); `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` Risk #2 row.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:305:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as 4 agents (Diagnostic W3-4 + Janitor W7-8 + Scribe W7-8 + Cash Conductor W9-10) under this contingency. Sourcing Scout becomes the W11-12 closer; Concierge is v1.1.
docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:312:- **Cascade:** v1.0 ships as Diagnostic + Janitor + Scribe + Cash Conductor only. Cash Conductor's three-accounting-API integration becomes founder solo work — likely extends to W8-9 instead of W7-8.

docs/decisions/sequencing-target.md:404:The W3 build / W4 first-render framing is internally consistent across master brief §8.2 ("Weeks 3-4" range), Ultraplan §9 line 753 ("Week 4: Diagnostic agent built end-to-end"), and ADR-003 design §5.2 — no discrepancy requires correction. The earlier draft concern about W3 vs W4 is resolved by the build-window-vs-completion-week distinction: Diagnostic build window is W3-W4; first production render lands W4.

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:219:- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:232:- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:272:| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification.

agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:279:### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:281:1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:283:3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.
agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md:297:- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures

Bullhorn-touching agents (Janitor W5+) gated on A+B response or 2026-06-10 force-fallback. Bullhorn partnership form submitted 2026-05-24 via verified Marketo form at `https://www.bullhorn.com/become-a-partner/` (response 2-5 business days). Diagnostic shipped Day 13 without Bullhorn dependency — 4 of 6 v1.0 agents no longer blocked on this risk. Sub-decisions A (marketplace vs direct) and B (OAuth flow) remain **Proposed**. **Reduction trigger 1 (Medium → Low):** A and B flip to Accepted when commercial answers land. **Reduction trigger 2 (Low → Closed):** first Bullhorn write lands cleanly in Janitor agent build (master brief §12 tripwire "core read endpoints working" passes). |

docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:61:- 2026-05-16 (Day 3) — Risk #5 entry updated with three-stage severity ladder per `sequencing-target.md` §4.1 + §6.4 (Blocking → High done Day 1 evening; High → Medium at W4 Diagnostic first render; Medium → Low at W13 all 5 v1.0 bundles rendered). Risk #7 edit count revised from 6 to 8 (`sequencing-target.md` §6.8 7th edit on master brief §6 Day 3 line 471 path drift + `brain-ui-scope.md` §4.5 8th edit on line 472 three-drift bundle). No new risks surfaced from Day 3 — sequencing-target ratifies master brief §8.2 sequence with explicit gating (no new risk surface); brain-ui-scope defers to v1.1 phase (no new risk surface). Two new escalation codes from Day 3 work registered: `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` (already in ADR-003 design §4.7) and the `decision_log.phase` enum extensions (`gating_failed`, `agent_handoff`) per `sequencing-target.md` §5-A — both Week-1+ implementation prereqs.
docs/RISK-REGISTER.md:64:- 2026-05-18 (Day 5) — **Day 5 decision artefacts shipped: `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` + `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` (both Status: Proposed).** Auto-send safety policy specifies 4-tier traffic light (green/yellow/orange/red), `hh_decision_action` integration per ADR-003 §2.1, 3 new `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` codes (`ESC_AUTOSEND_NEEDS_REVIEW`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED`, `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`), pilot-agreement liability placeholder (legal review required before first LOI), v1.0 ships green+red only / yellow+orange phased to v1.1. Kill criterion specifies 10 binary triggers spanning design-partner gap (Trigger 1 = Week-3 PAUSE), renderer build (Trigger 2 = W3 KILL), Bullhorn auth (Trigger 3 = W5 PIVOT), scope cuts (Trigger 4 from sequencing-target §6.6), autosend miscategorisations (Trigger 5), unit economics + infra cost (Triggers 6+7 = PIVOT), Gate B revenue (Trigger 8 = KILL per master brief example), cortextOS primitive stability (Trigger 9), PII leakage (Trigger 10 = unilateral KILL). **Risk #3 escalated from Medium to High** — zero design partners in pipeline as of Day 5; original "conversation 1" assumption invalidated. **Risk #7 edit count revised from 9 to 10** with new Edit 10 (master brief §6 Day 5 lines 484-485 path drift `docs/` root → `docs/decisions/`). Codex Day-7 queue grows from 15 to 17 (both Day-5 artefacts).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:62:- §8.2 v1.0 build order: **A4 Cash Conductor (Tier 1, weeks 7-8)** and **A6 Concierge (Tier 1, weeks 9-10)** require it.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:63:- §8.1 v1.0 build order: A2 Janitor and A3 Scribe are Tier-2 (cron / webhook) and do NOT depend on primitive 1.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:121:- v1.0 build: **A6 Concierge** (master brief §8.2, weeks 9-10) holds candidate-lifecycle state across days; loses context-rollover gracefulness if this primitive fails.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:161:The bus is real, well-tested at unit and integration layers, with HMAC-SHA256 message signing and a documented 3-directory lifecycle. However, **two pieces of the master-brief description are wrong against the verified SHA `c21fbfe`** — flagged below; both affect the brain-replacement boundary (§3.4) and need founder review before Day 7.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:169:- `src/bus/message.ts:19-44` — HMAC-SHA256 signing using `${ctxRoot}/config/bus-signing-key`. Quirk 5 in `.agents/learnings/00-cortextos-quirks.md` confirms each instance has its own key (IFOS and Personal have separate HMAC keys).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:189:- §8.2 v1.1: A8 **Brief Decoder** is the load-bearing test of the file bus + handoff to Sourcing Scout → Concierge (Ultraplan §3.1 row 3: "This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2"). v1.0 agents don't strictly depend on the bus for inter-agent handoff — but they do depend on it for KB read/write.
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:257:- v1.1: A7 Inbound Triage's auto-send is the most dangerous; per Ultraplan §8.2 A7 gotcha: "Misclassification of a complaint as a routine inbound is a relationship killer."
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:390:- v1.1: **A11 Night Sourcer** (Ultraplan §8.2, weeks 9-10) is the canonical use case — "8-12 reviewed candidates per brief every morning at 06:30" (Product Spec §2.2 R4).
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:393:**Risk if flaky:** Night Sourcer becomes a daytime cron with rate-limit pain — kills the "Walk in to 27 reviewed candidates across your live briefs every morning" pitch (Product Spec §10 line 525). Per Ultraplan §10 Risk #6: "LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl are tighter than expected → defer Night Sourcer to v1.2 if needed" — overnight autoresearch is also the budgeting layer for the LinkedIn rate limit (Ultraplan §8.2 A11 gotcha: "Build the rate-limit budget allocator carefully; this is where £40-60/mo of the £200 per-tenant compute cost lives").
docs/architecture/cortexos-primitive-status.md:457:- v1.1: **A8 Brief Decoder** (Ultraplan §8.2 weeks 5-6) is the load-bearing test — it's the canonical "Brief Decoder → Sourcing Scout → Concierge" 4-agent handoff. Ultraplan §3.1 row 3 already names this as the bus's load-bearing test ("This is the load-bearing one for Brief Decoder. If not ready, Brief Decoder slips to v1.2").

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:459:  - **Git:** **Spec gap 2.4-A.** Neither master brief nor Ultraplan specifies whether `/vault/{tenant}/` is also a git repo. Obsidian users typically git-init their vaults. **Recommendation:** yes — initialize `/vault/{tenant}/.git/` at tenant provisioning (Ultraplan §5.5 step 2). Founder gets free history, blame, and rollback via Obsidian Git plugin. Agents do NOT commit; the founder commits manually or via a scheduled cron run by Janitor's nightly sweep. **Blocks v1.0 build:** no — git init is one line in `provision-tenant.sh`; commit cadence can be decided in Week 1.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:607:- compiled/ entity pages — searched by `search-by-name` (trigram) and `search-by-attribute` (JSONB GIN). Embedding compiled/ pages is v1.1+ if reflect.ts wants semantic dedup.

docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:751:v1.0 agents per master brief §8.2: Diagnostic (no vault writes; sales-only), Janitor (heavy writes — nightly batch of thousands of Bullhorn entity updates), Scribe (per-call writes; ~30-60 min/day per consultant per Product Spec §2.2 R6), Cash Conductor (writes Placement updates on invoice events; reads heavily for invoice context), Sourcing Scout (read-heavy; produces drafts that the agent itself writes elsewhere), Concierge (per-lifecycle-event writes; reads candidate state on every inbound).

At Boutique-tier these all run in one PM2 process group per tenant; at Scale-tier the same.
docs/architecture/second-brain-design.md:944:- **Week 13:** wiki-aware agent integration — Concierge (v1.0 A6, master brief §8.2) is the first user; voice-loader.sh from §2.4.3 reads `voice_samples_embedded` via the new library; first end-to-end Concierge run hits the wiki for `search-by-name` and `update-entity`. Brain UI minimal v1 (the "what did the agents do today" view from master brief §6 Day 3) is built as a thin read-only page over `decision_log` — no new wiki API needed.

docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md:44:Intel Force OS is the recruitment product. CortexOS is the runtime. We build the product on top of the runtime without modifying it. Every agent is a bundle of six files in a canonical pattern. Every tenant is a process group, a vault directory, and a row in three Postgres tables. Voice is RAG-plus-scaffolding at v1, LoRA at Scale-tier v2. Quality is three gates that get measured weekly, not a slogan that gets put on the website. Onboarding is a five-day wizard, not a five-week project. The build is sequenced for "close the first three pilots fastest" — Maddox's stated default in Q3 — which means the Janitor and Cash Conductor close demos before the Triage agent absorbs the development heat.

docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:9:**Reading order:** master brief §6 Day 2 + §8.2 (agent dependencies) + §3.2 (adapter boundary first-party MCP list) first; then this document end-to-end; then `docs/decisions/ADR-002-brain-system-as-parallel-not-shadow.md` §2.4.2 + `agent-bundle-renderer-design.md` §2.1 spec gap §2.1-C for the credential storage substrate this decision feeds into.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:23:**Sub-decision C — v1.0 endpoint surface.** Which Bullhorn endpoints each of the v1.0 agents (Janitor, Scribe, Sourcing Scout, Concierge — see §1.2) reads and writes, the cadence (real-time webhook vs scheduled poll vs ad-hoc request-response), and the rate-limit budget allocation. Ultraplan §8.1 specifies per-agent Bullhorn touches at lines 510 (Janitor: read-write), 522 (Scribe: write), 551 (Sourcing Scout: read for ATS passive matches), 564 (Concierge: read for state, write for activity log) — Sub-decision C consolidates these into one per-agent endpoint table and decides webhook-vs-poll per integration point.
docs/decisions/bullhorn-integration-path.md:27:Master brief §12 Risk #2 (Bullhorn auth path) — "Bullhorn MCP build takes longer than 1 week" — names this as one of the four risks that could kill v1.0. Tripwire: "End of week 3 status not 'core read endpoints working'" (master brief §12 row #2, Ultraplan §10 row #2). The mitigation is "Week 0 Day 2 on Bullhorn auth research" — i.e. this document. Without Sub-decisions A and B answered, Week 1 cannot begin scaffolding `packages/mcp-connectors/bullhorn/` because the connector's authentication path determines its scope and shape.

Every agent now has a quantified revenue story, not just a time-saved story.** The internal business plan and the 24/7 directive had revenue stories for some agents (Cash Conductor, Client Hunter, T5) but not all.

Janitor was pitched on database hygiene; here it's pitched on "one reactivated dormant-but-clean candidate per month covers the tier price".
docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md:458:- **No free pilots beyond the structured 14-day Janitor cleanup trial.** Free pilots train customers to expect free.

   131	
   132	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check.
   133	
   134	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 pilot scale; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); emerging from v1.0 pilot operations.
   135	
   136	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vector: cheaper Claude model tier (Haiku 4.5 for routine actions, Sonnet for complex), or reduced agent run frequency (e.g., Sourcing Scout runs nightly batch instead of real-time), or per-tenant cost passthrough in pricing.
   137	
   138	**Recovery path:** Rescoped pricing/architecture; pivoted v1.0 continues.
   139	
   140	### Trigger 7 — INFRASTRUCTURE-COST-MONTHLY (PIVOT)
   141	
   142	**Threshold:** Total Hetzner monthly infrastructure cost exceeds **£100/month at 3 active tenants**.
   143	
   144	**Rationale:** 15x headroom from the current £6.40/month single-tenant baseline (per Day-4 runbook §1.4: CX22 + 50 GB volume + backups = €5 + €1.20 + €2.40 ≈ £6.40). At 3 tenants on shared single-server architecture, expected cost should remain near baseline. If Postgres + LUKS-volume growth + vector-index growth pushes >£100/month at 3 tenants, infrastructure approach needs pivot.
   145	
   146	**Owner:** Founder; monthly check via Hetzner billing.
   147	
   148	**Source:** Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (£20/mo for v1.0 single-tenant pilot; master brief does not specify a numeric cost target); Risk #4 in `docs/RISK-REGISTER.md` (Hire #1 delays compound infrastructure spend if architecture sprawls).
   149	
   150	**Action:** PIVOT — likely vectors:
   151	
   152	- **Self-host:** founder's Mac Studio cluster from prior research as primary; Hetzner as backup. Saves money but adds maintenance.
   153	- **Provider switch:** alternate eu-central provider (Mythic Beasts, OVH, Scaleway) with better price-per-tenant economics.
   154	- **Architecture compaction:** per-tenant resource pooling rather than per-tenant servers.
   155	
   156	**Recovery path:** Rescoped infrastructure plan; pivoted v1.0 continues with adjusted Day-4 runbook §1.4 founder-set cost budget (master brief does not specify a numeric cost target; budget adjustment is a runbook revision, not a master-brief edit).
   157	
   158	### Trigger 8 — GATE-B-REVENUE-UPLIFT (KILL)
   159	
   160	**Threshold:** After 3 completed pilots (defined as: pilot ran for ≥90 days with active agent fleet and quarterly Gate B revenue measurement), average Gate B revenue uplift per tenant <£20k/year.
   161	
   162	**Owner:** Founder; assessed at end of each pilot.
   163	
   164	**Source:** Master brief §6 Day 5 line 486 — canonical example trigger from master brief.
   165	
   166	**Action:** KILL. Rationale: the wedge does not produce demonstrable ROI at the threshold required to sustain v1.0 commercially. £20k/year/tenant is the breakeven floor — below this, IFOS cannot fund continued operation at v1.0 pricing.
   167	
   168	**Recovery path:** None within v1.0. Lessons feed v1.1 if launched. The vertical assumption (UK recruitment) or product assumption (agent fleet vs. point tools) may need reconsidering for any next initiative.
   169	
   170	### Trigger 9 — CORTEXOS-PRIMITIVE-CHRONIC-FAILURE (PAUSE)
   171	
   172	**Threshold:** cortextOS primitives 3 (file bus per `cortexos-primitive-status.md` line item 3) or 4 (approval gates per primitive 4) report >1 production incident per week across **2 consecutive weeks** for any single pilot.
   173	
   174	**Threshold tightened Day 5 (2026-05-18) from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.** Rationale: Risk #1 severity was downgraded Day 1 because primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" per `cortexos-primitive-status.md`. If field evidence shows failure-rate spike for 2 consecutive weeks, that is an actionable signal — waiting 4 weeks delays remediation by 50% within the v1.0 build timeline (Weeks 1-13).
   175	
   176	**Owner:** IFOS oncall; weekly check via `decision_log` + cortextOS daemon logs.
   177	
   178	**Source:** Master brief §12 Risk #1; Day-1 audit results in `cortexos-primitive-status.md` (primitive 1 PTY/PM2 is "shipped but flaky"; primitives 3 + 4 confirmed "shipped and tested" but field evidence may diverge).
   179	
   180	**Action:** PAUSE. Rationale: cortextOS primitive instability is a structural threat to every IFOS agent — every agent uses the file bus and most use approval gates. Chronic failure points to either (a) cortextOS regression upstream OR (b) IFOS usage pattern incompatible with cortextOS at scale.

   512	- **Build complexity:** **L** (2 weeks) — the Bullhorn MCP work is the rate-limiting piece
   513	- **Gotchas:** Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0. Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself. Dedup is hard; start conservative (high-confidence merges only) and tune up.

     2	
     3	**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
     4	**Date:** 2026-05-24.
     5	**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
     6	**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
     7	**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
     8	**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

    12	## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)
    13	
    14	Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.
    15	
    16	> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).
    17	
    18	---
    19	
    20	## §2 — Invocation surface
    21	
    22	### Cron (v1.0)
    23	
    24	```bash
    25	# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
    26	0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
    27	```
    28	
    29	Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.
    30	
    31	### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)
    32	
    33	```bash
    34	ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
    35	```
    36	
    37	`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).
    38	
    39	### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)
    40	
    41	- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
    42	- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)
    43	
    44	---
    45	
    46	## §3 — Output shape
    47	
    48	Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.
    49	
    50	### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report
    51	
    52	Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:
    53	
    54	| # | Section | Content |
    55	|---|---|---|
    56	| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
    57	| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: CRNs, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
    58	| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
    59	| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
    60	| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
    61	| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | Composite score: (dedup % improvement × 0.5) + (field-completeness % improvement × 0.5). Target ≥12.5 (≥15% dedup + ≥10% field) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 |
    62	| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
    63	| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |
    64	
    65	### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)
    66	
    67	Three write categories. Action types map to `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` — existing entries are used as-is; new entries are flagged for catalogue addition at W5 build (per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern):
    68	
    69	1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim). Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_dedupe`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 69; yellow tier; sample_rate: 10).
    70	2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing canonical schema fields (per `vertical-schema.yaml`): `candidate.location` line 89, `client.size_employees` line 243, `contractor.day_rate_min`/`day_rate_max` lines 193-197, `brief.salary_min`/`salary_max` lines 371-376 from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload. Action type: **`bullhorn_field_backfill` (new — flagged for autosend-policy.yaml addition at W5 build with proposed tier=yellow + sample_rate=10)**.
    71	3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window. Action type: **`bullhorn_candidate_tag`** (existing in autosend-policy.yaml line 35; green tier — note appends are non-customer-facing; metadata reversible).
    72	
    73	Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type` per the mapping above, `tier` per autosend-policy.yaml, payload includes source confidence + provenance.
    74	
    75	---
    76	
    77	## §4 — Workflow
    78	
    79	12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.
    80	
    81	```
    82	0. Session start
    83	   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
    84	     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
    85	   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")
    86	
    87	1. Bullhorn auth refresh
    88	   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
    89	     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
    90	   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries
    91	
    92	2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
    93	   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
    94	     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
    95	     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
    96	   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
    97	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)
    98	
    99	3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   100	   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   101	   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   102	   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   103	   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
   104	     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   105	   → batch into proposed-merge list (in-memory intermediate; not persisted —
   106	     hh_decision_action emitted at Step 9 when each merge actually writes)
   107	
   108	4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   109	   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
   110	     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)
   111	
   112	5. Field completeness audit (canonical field names per vertical-schema.yaml)
   113	   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location (line 89),
   114	     client.industry (line 252), client.size_employees (line 243),
   115	     contractor.day_rate_min/day_rate_max (lines 193-197),
   116	     brief.salary_min/salary_max (lines 371-376)
   117	   → identify missing-field rows
   118	   → batch enrichment calls
   119	   → hh_decision_output("field_completeness_audit", tenant, "<N> missing-field rows")
   120	
   121	6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   122	   → companies_house.search(client.legal_name) → CRN → profile → fill industry +
   123	     registered_office_address + sic_codes
   124	   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   125	   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429
   126	
   127	7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   128	   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
   129	     signup commercial decision)
   130	   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
   131	     current_company → write back
   132	
   133	8. Tacit-note harvest
   134	   → query decision_log for recent_edit rows in last 30 days for this tenant
   135	     where resolution='approved_after_edit'
   136	   → group by target_entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   137	   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
   138	     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)
   139	
   140	9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   141	   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
   142	     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   143	   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   144	   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   145	   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff
   146	
   147	10. Day-30 report assembly
   148	   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
   149	     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   150	   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   151	   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   152	   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   153	   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")
   154	
   155	11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   156	   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   157	   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
   158	     summary suggesting consultant follow-up
   159	   → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "tenant:<slug>",
   160	     notification_hash, "gate_b_state:met|missed; chars:<N>")
   161	
   162	12. Session close
   163	   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   164	   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   165	   → exit code 0 (or 1 if Gate-B missed for 3 consecutive runs → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
   166	```

   169	
   170	## §5 — Gates
   171	
   172	### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)
   173	
   174	Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:
   175	
   176	- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
   177	- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
   178	- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   179	- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
   180	- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
   181	- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
   182	- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)
   183	
   184	Gate A failures fire `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` + draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required.
   185	
   186	### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)
   187	
   188	Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.
   189	
   190	Composite score = (dedup% × 0.5) + (field-completeness% × 0.5). Target ≥12.5.
   191	
   192	Gate B doesn't block the agent. It's the v1.0 kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 supporting metric ("Gate-B revenue uplift" — Janitor's day-30 report is THE artefact that demonstrates "DSO drops" / "consultant time saved" claims to the FD-tier closer).
   193	
   194	Below ≥12.5 for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).
   195	
   196	---
   197	
   198	## §6 — Escalation codes
   199	
   200	**Note:** Codes marked `(new)` in the table below are flagged for addition to `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` at this agent's W5 build slice per `review-agent-bundle.md` §1 row §6 flag-for-addition pattern. Existing codes match `escalation-codes.md` definitions verbatim.
   201	
   202	| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
   203	|---|---|---|---|

   214	Janitor does NOT use:
   215	
   216	- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by nightly voice-drift cron (per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger: ≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from same tenant in rolling 7d window). Janitor only fires the per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`; aggregate `_TENANT` rollup is handled by the canary not Janitor.
   217	- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's for red-tier blocks (`escalation-codes.md` line 41); Janitor writes are yellow tier only
   218	- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated handling; Concierge owns the cross-agent escalation
   219	- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (line 163) — that's for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time; Janitor's Gate A failures map to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint) instead, per the catalogue's intended-use distinction
   220	
   221	---
   222	
   223	## §7 — Voice + tone constraints
   224	
   225	Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:
   226	
   227	- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
   228	  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
   229	  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
   230	  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
   231	- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
   232	- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries (Janitor emits per-run). Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` line 170-175 trigger (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7d window); Janitor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC codes — they inform the canary's threshold tuning over time.
   233	
   234	Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

   237	
   238	## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)
   239	
   240	Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:
   241	
   242	| Dependency | Source | Status |
   243	|---|---|---|
   244	| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
   245	| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
   246	| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
   247	| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
   248	| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
   249	| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
   250	| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
   251	| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
   252	| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
   253	| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
   254	| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
   255	| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
   256	| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
   257	| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
   258	| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
   259	
   260	**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.
   261	
   262	---
   263	
   264	## §9 — Status + open questions
   265	
   266	**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.
   267	
   268	### Open questions for founder review
   269	
   270	| # | Question | Resolution path |
   271	|---|---|---|
   272	| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
   273	| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
   274	| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
   275	| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
   276	| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
   277	| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |
   278	
   279	### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)
   280	
   281	1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
   282	2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
   283	3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.
   284	
   285	---
   286	
   287	## §10 — When this document ratifies
   288	
   289	Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill: this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.
   290	
   291	Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
   292	- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
   293	- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
   294	- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer
   295	
   296	Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
   297	- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
   298	- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
   299	- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
   300	- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)
   301	
   302	Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.
   303

   174	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id` AND `ifos_oncall_chat_id` (CSM may need to retrain voice corpus)
   175	- **Payload fields:** `tenant_slug`, `drift_event_count`, `window_days`, `affected_agents` (list of agent_name)
   176	
   177	#### `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL`
   178	- **Severity:** warn
   179	- **Trigger:** Agent rejected its input at the validation gate (e.g. malformed firm name, missing required CLI argument, brief description too short). Detected at Step 1 of the agent's workflow BEFORE any tool calls or LLM invocations
   180	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   181	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   182	- **Payload fields:** `input_field`, `input_value_preview` (truncated to 80 chars), `validation_rule_violated`
   183	
   184	#### `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`
   185	- **Severity:** warn
   186	- **Trigger:** Agent produced output that doesn't match its declared output shape (e.g. Diagnostic report with section count != 12, missing per-section citation, validate.sh V1/V2 check fail). Distinct from `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` which is for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write-time
   187	- **Phase:** `gating_failed`
   188	- **Routing:** `operator_chat_id`
   189	- **Payload fields:** `agent_name`, `output_path`, `shape_rule_violated`, `expected_value`, `actual_value`

1. Autosend tier mapping is internally contradictory and misuses an existing action type. Line 16 says all Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier, but line 71 maps tacit-note attach to `bullhorn_candidate_tag`, which `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` line 35 defines as a green tag action, not note append. Fix by using or adding a Janitor-specific yellow note-append action type and making §1/§3/§4 agree.

2. `bullhorn_field_backfill` is an unregistered action type. Line 70 makes it part of the output contract, but `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` has no such row; `hook-helpers.sh` lines 202-207 fail-safe unknown actions to red with `ESC_AUTOSEND_POLICY_LOOKUP_FAILED`. Fix by adding the policy row before ratification or marking field backfill as a blocked W5 prerequisite, not an executable output.

3. Gate A escalation handling contradicts itself. Line 184 says Gate A failures fire `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`, while line 219 says Janitor does not use `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` and maps Gate A failures to `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`. Fix §5 and §6 to use the correct catalogue code consistently, with `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` reserved for vertical-schema write-time constraint failures.

4. The artefact assumes schema fields that do not exist. Lines 122-123 say Companies House enrichment fills `client.legal_name`, `registered_office_address`, and `sic_codes`, but `vertical-schema.yaml` exposes client `name`, `industry`, `size_employees`, `website`, and `companies_house_number` around lines 235-255, not those fields. Fix by either using existing schema fields or landing a v0.2 schema supplement before the agent contract depends on them.

5. Citation and metric framing for kill-criterion Trigger 8 is inaccurate. Line 192 claims Janitor’s report demonstrates “DSO drops” and “consultant time saved” for the FD-tier closer, but `v1.0-kill-criterion.md` lines 158-166 define Trigger 8 as average Gate-B revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots; DSO is Cash Conductor territory. Fix by tying Janitor Gate B to revenue uplift evidence without claiming DSO, or remove the Trigger 8 claim.
