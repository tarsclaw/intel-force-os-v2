=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

---

*End of top-level SKILL.md. Apply the relevant type-specific skill next.*

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: architecture-decision ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-architecture-decision

Type-specific checks for: ADRs (`docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`), decision docs (`docs/decisions/*.md` other than ADRs), reference designs (`docs/architecture/*.md`), runbooks (`docs/runbooks/*.md`).

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

---

## §1 — Decision-doc shape requirements

Every artefact of this type MUST have:

1. **Status field** — one of `Proposed | Accepted | In Force | Reference | Superseded | Deprecated`. Match the file's content honestly:
   - `Proposed` = the decision exists but hasn't been ratified or actioned
   - `Accepted` = founder has approved + work is underway/done
   - `In Force` = the decision is binding operational policy right now
   - `Reference` = factual recording (audits, inventories, manifests)
   - `Superseded` = a later artefact replaces this one
   - `Deprecated` = the decision is no longer applied

   REJECT if status is missing, conflicts with content (e.g., "Accepted" but Sub-decisions are "Proposed pending commercial conversations"), or is "Accepted" without a Founder decision date.

2. **Context section** — explains the problem before the solution. Should be readable cold; if a new reader can't tell what this decision is about from the Context alone, REJECT. **Required for ALL statuses.**

3. **Decision section** — names the choice, not the deliberation. If the artefact is mostly deliberation with no clear decision, REJECT. **Required for `Proposed | Accepted`. EXEMPT for `Reference` (audits, inventories, manifests) and `In Force` (runbooks, operational standing policies) — those artefacts encode their "decisions" in the working content itself (audit findings table; runbook procedure steps); a separate Decision heading would be redundant ceremony.**

4. **Alternatives considered** — for ADRs, at least 2 alternatives MUST be named + rejected with reasons. If only one option is presented, REJECT — that's a memo, not a decision document. **Required for `Proposed | Accepted` ADRs only. EXEMPT for non-ADR Reference + In Force artefacts.**

5. **Consequences section** — what changes downstream. Includes risk register implications, master brief edits authorised (if any), downstream-artefact updates required. **Required for `Proposed | Accepted`. EXEMPT for `Reference` + `In Force` — downstream impact may be inline (e.g., "Day-7 single-sentence test Q2 references this audit") rather than under a dedicated heading; verify via cross-references in body text.**

6. **Status update line at end** — current state ("Accepted on 2026-05-16 by founder + Claude Code") OR ratification-pending note. **Required for ALL statuses.**

### §1-Exemption — Softening for Reference + In Force (Codex Round 1 D5)

The exemptions in items 3, 4, 5 above are the result of Founder Decision D5 (commit `2026-05-22`) resolving the disagreement at `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-20-decision-doc-shape-on-audits.md`. Reference artefacts (e.g., `cortexos-primitive-status.md` audit, `architecture-cohesion-review.md`, `tenancy-invariants.md`) and In Force artefacts (e.g., `operational-hygiene-protocol.md` runbook, `tenant-lifecycle.md` runbook) legitimately do not have "decisions" or "alternatives weighed" — they document findings or procedures.

**The Context requirement (item 2) and Status update line (item 6) still apply to ALL artefacts under this skill.** Citation accuracy (§3) and boundary checks (top-level SKILL.md §2) also apply to all.

If a `Reference` or `In Force` artefact is making material architectural claims that warrant deliberation, RATIFY with an advisory note suggesting the author consider promoting parts to an ADR. Do not REJECT solely for the missing Decision/Consequences sections on these status types.

---

## §2 — ADR-specific structure (for files matching `ADR-*.md`)

In addition to §1, ADRs MUST:

- Have a numbered identifier in the filename matching the contents ("ADR-003" in filename → "# ADR-003 —" as the H1)
- Be sequentially numbered (no gaps — ADR-001 → 002 → 003 → 004)
- Link to predecessor ADRs if extending or referring to them
- Have at least one "Decision" heading + at least one explicit "Decision 1 — <terse summary>" subheading per distinct decision

REJECT if any of these are missing.

---

## §3 — Citation accuracy (heavily-tested area)

Past audits found 15 fabricated `§10.4` references in one batch. Recurrence is likely. Check:

For every cited section reference (e.g., "master brief §6 Day 7 line 502"):

1. Open the cited file
2. Find the cited section
3. Verify the citation matches the content the artefact claims it does

If even one citation is wrong, REJECT with the specific citation listed. Past pattern: `master brief §10.4 cost target` cited 15 times; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list with no cost-target content.

For relative references ("per ADR-003 §3.3.3"), confirm the section exists in the predecessor.

For commit-SHA references (e.g., `c21fbfe`, `fec8872`), confirm the SHA matches the artefact's date + makes sense in context. Don't require running `git show` if the SHA is consistent with the narrative.

---

## §4 — Master brief edit authorisation

If the ADR authorises master brief edits (an "## Master brief edits authorised by this ADR" section):

1. The proposed text MUST be quoted verbatim — both current AND proposed.
2. The edit's line numbers MUST match the live master brief (sample-check at least one).
3. Edits MUST land in either (a) this commit, (b) the next atomic-correction commit, or (c) an explicit deferred queue. Vague "later" disposition = REJECT.
4. Risk #7 (master-brief-drift-accumulation) edit count MUST update if this ADR adds edits to the queue.

---

## §5 — Spec-gap surfacing

Reference design docs often surface spec gaps (`§N.M-A`, `§N.M-B` etc.). Each gap MUST:

- Be numbered uniquely within the design doc
- State the gap (what's missing in the upstream spec)
- Recommend a resolution OR be explicitly deferred to a named owner + week
- Not contradict each other (gap §2.1-A resolution must not break gap §2.1-B resolution)

REJECT if a gap is stated without a resolution path AND not explicitly deferred with owner + trigger.

---

## §6 — Implementation deviation acknowledgement

If the ADR ratifies deviations from a predecessor ADR (e.g., ADR-004 deviates from ADR-003):

1. Predecessor MUST be linked
2. Each deviation MUST be numbered + reasoned individually
3. Predecessor's text MUST be quoted to show what's being deviated from
4. Reason for deviation MUST be concrete (citing a boundary, a runtime constraint, a discovered bug — not "felt cleaner")
5. Rollback or alternative path MUST be named ("if rejected: build X shim instead")

REJECT if deviations are listed without quoting the predecessor or without concrete reasoning.

---

## §7 — Decision_log audit fields (master brief §8.1 Change 2)

Architecture decisions don't directly write to `decision_log` (the agent runtime does), but they MAY constrain what the runtime writes. Check:

- If the decision adds a `decision_log.phase` value: confirm Day-4 §6.3 schema CHECK constraint includes it (`trigger | output | action | gating_failed | agent_handoff`)
- If the decision adds a new ESC code: confirm `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` (Phase 1 of Day 8) has the code listed
- If the decision references `payload.tier` or `payload.<key>`: confirm autosend-safety-policy §7 documents the field shape
- If the decision restricts `agent_name` values: confirm sentinel names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`, `_shared`) are consistent with usage

REJECT if a decision adds an enum value or column to `decision_log` without confirming the schema supports it.

---

## §8 — Boundary-specific rejections for this artefact type

In addition to the four boundaries in `SKILL.md` §2:

- **Submodule reference** — decision docs MAY name cortextOS files for reference (e.g., `add-agent.ts:131-140`); they MUST NOT propose modifying them. If the ADR proposes a modification to `packages/harness/cortextos/*` outside the shadow points, REJECT.

- **Adapter boundary** — `Composio` and `AgentMail` may appear in INTERNAL discussion text (e.g., "we considered Composio") but MUST NOT appear in `tools.yaml` shape definitions, agent.md examples, or schema fixtures. If the ADR proposes including either in any of those locations, REJECT.

- **v1 source code** — `~/code/intel-force-os/` (the v1 codebase) MUST NOT be modified. ADRs MAY reference v1 for prior-art lessons; MUST NOT instruct edits.

---

## §9 — Common false-RATIFY traps to watch for

Past patterns that look RATIFIABLE but should REJECT:

- **"Trust me" architecture** — the artefact asserts a design works without alternatives weighed. Even simple decisions need at least one weighted alternative.

- **Over-elaborated worked examples** — a 200-line "Concierge worked example" inside an architecture decision is a red flag for masking a thin decision underneath. Skim the worked example; if the decision itself is < 50 lines, REJECT and demand more decision-content.

- **Status drift** — file says `Accepted` but content includes `TODO`, `pending`, `to be decided`. REJECT.

- **Hidden caveats** — major limitations buried at the bottom in a "Notes" section. Surface to the Decision or Consequences section. REJECT.

- **Cross-cite hallucination** — references "as documented in §X" but §X doesn't actually document it. Check.

- **Numbered options that omit the chosen one's reasoning** — "Options: A, B, C. Chose B." but no reasoning for WHY B. REJECT.

---

## §10 — When to RATIFY-with-notes

Use this sparingly. RATIFIED-with-notes is appropriate when:

- The artefact passes all required checks but has typos or wording suboptimalities
- A genuinely advisory observation worth surfacing but not blocking
- The author should fix-up at next touch but the merge is fine

Anything load-bearing — citation errors, spec gaps without resolution, status drift, boundary violations — is REJECTED, not RATIFIED-with-notes. If you find yourself adding more than 5 lines of notes, the artefact has structural issues and should be REJECTED.

---

## §11 — Quick checklist (run this for every ADR-type artefact)

- [ ] Has Status field with valid value matching content
- [ ] Has Context, Decision, Consequences sections
- [ ] (If ADR) Numbered + sequentially located + has alternatives weighed
- [ ] All citations verifiable (sample at least 3)
- [ ] No fabricated section references
- [ ] No submodule modifications proposed outside shadow points
- [ ] No Composio/AgentMail in `tools.yaml`/`agent.md` examples
- [ ] No v1-source modifications proposed
- [ ] Any master-brief edits include current+proposed text + line numbers + disposition
- [ ] Spec gaps (if any) have named resolution or deferred owner
- [ ] Status field matches content honesty (no Accepted-with-pending-sub-decisions unless explicitly noted)

If all clear: RATIFIED.
If any fail: REJECTED with numbered issues citing specifics.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Diagnostic — the sales tool

**Status:** Proposed (Day-11 pre-W3-build draft; awaits Q1 LOI + Codex ratification at first render).
**Date:** 2026-05-22.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 row 1 (anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`.
**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1.
**Tier:** 2 (request-driven; no persistent PTY) per sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least one evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) backing every factual claim — Gate A hard-fails on missing citations. The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### CLI (v1.0)

```bash
# Manual consultant invocation, run from anywhere
ifosctl diagnostic \
  --firm "Charterhouse Partners" \
  --sector "fintech" \                  # optional; helps tighten ICP fit scoring
  --tenant <slug>                       # which tenant's target_patch + voice corpus to use
  --notify-via telegram                 # optional; pings consultant when done
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY) → exits within 10-15 min per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 turnaround target.

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Diagnose Firm" button → triggers via internal API
- Telegram bot command (`@ifos_bot diagnose Charterhouse Partners`)
- Bulk-mode (`ifosctl diagnostic --firm-list firms.csv`) — out of v1.0 scope

---

## §3 — The 12 required sections

Every report MUST contain these 12 sections in order. Gate A enforces section count + per-section citation.

| # | Section | What it contains | Source(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Firm signal** | Companies House data: registered name, company number, incorporation date, latest filed accounts (revenue band + headcount band), registered office, recent director changes, share-class moves | Companies House API |
| 2 | **Online footprint** | Primary website URL + last-updated signal; LinkedIn company page URL + follower count + last-post recency; careers page URL + state (active / placeholder / 404) | Web scraper (HEAD + first 200 lines); LinkedIn company-page fetch |
| 3 | **Sector + role-type mix** | Sectors actively recruiting for (extracted from current job posts); ratio of permanent vs contract roles in last 90 days; technical-vs-commercial-vs-operational split | LinkedIn job posts + careers page job listings |
| 4 | **Geography** | Office locations + current hiring locations + remote-vs-onsite-vs-hybrid mix | LinkedIn job posts (location field) + Companies House registered office |
| 5 | **Deal-size band proxy** | Salary bands or day-rate ranges visible in job posts; level distribution (junior / mid / senior / executive); recent placements visible via LinkedIn employees-of-firm field changes | LinkedIn job posts + LinkedIn employee timeline scan |
| 6 | **ICP fit vs target_patch** | Score 0-100 against tenant's `target_patch.json` (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band_gbp from `common-target-patch.json`). Includes named matches/mismatches per dimension | Tenant config + sections 1-5 above |
| 7 | **Tech stack signals** | Technologies named in JDs + LinkedIn skills aggregated from current employees + tools mentioned in director posts | LinkedIn JDs + LinkedIn employee profiles |
| 8 | **Pain signals** | Phrases on careers page suggesting urgency ("rapid growth", "we're scaling fast", "looking to triple the team"); LinkedIn director posts mentioning hiring pressure or "we need help"; Glassdoor reviews mentioning workload/burnout (if accessible) | Careers page scrape + LinkedIn director post search + optional Glassdoor scrape |
| 9 | **Competitor positioning** | Other recruitment firms visible in the candidate flow: LinkedIn employee profiles showing previous-employer agency names; @firm tags in LinkedIn recruitment-agency posts; LinkedIn "Who's hiring this firm" inference where visible | LinkedIn profile scrapes + agency-tag search |
| 10 | **Recent activity** | LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + summary); press releases or news mentions (basic Google search); funding events visible on Companies House (share allotments, new director appointments) | LinkedIn company page + Google web search + Companies House filing history |
| 11 | **Decision-maker map** | Named people likely to be buyers: head of talent / chief people officer / hiring manager equivalents. LinkedIn profile URL per person. Tenure at firm. Recent activity. | LinkedIn employee search filtered by title |
| 12 | **Conversation opener** | 2-3 sentence cold outreach pitch. Tailored to surfaced pain signals (§8). Written in consultant's voice (voice-classified). Includes specific evidence anchor (e.g., "I noticed you've doubled engineering headcount in 6 months based on your LinkedIn — congrats on the Series A. Curious how you're handling sourcing pressure at that pace.") | LLM-generated; voice-classified against tenant style guide |

**Gate A hard-fails:**

- Fewer than 12 sections present
- Any section with zero citation links
- Section 12 (conversation opener) failing voice-classifier with score < 0.75
- Output exceeds 2000 words OR is under 400 words (length-discipline boundary)

---

## §4 — Workflow

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every workflow step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start — invocation arrives via CLI ifosctl diagnostic
   → context.sh hydrates: voice corpus + tone rules + recent edits + target_patch.json
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", firm_name + sector_hint)

1. Validate input
   → validate.sh checks: firm name non-empty, sector (if provided) in known list,
     tenant_slug present, voice corpus reachable
   → Gate A: hard-fail if any check fails
   → ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION if firm name malformed

2. Companies House lookup (Section 1)
   → companies_house_lookup(firm_name) via Companies House MCP connector
   → cache result for 7 days per gotcha §6 (rate-limit discipline)
   → extract: registration + revenue band + headcount band + directors + share moves
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Companies House returns 429 (back off 60s, retry once)

3. Online footprint discovery (Section 2)
   → web HEAD + first 200 lines fetch on probable URLs:
     {firm}.com / {firm}.co.uk / linkedin.com/company/{slug}
   → LinkedIn company-page fetch (Proxycurl or similar)
   → record careers page state + last-updated signal

4. Job posts harvest (Sections 3 + 4 + 5 + 7)
   → LinkedIn job posts API (filtered to firm) — up to 50 most recent
   → careers page scrape if accessible
   → extract: sector, role type, location, salary band, tech stack
   → Gotcha §6: store summarised data only; do not retain raw profiles per LinkedIn ToS

5. Director + employee scan (Sections 7 + 11)
   → LinkedIn search for {firm} employees with titles matching head-of-talent / chro / chief people / hiring-manager / talent-acquisition variants
   → record name + URL + tenure + recent activity
   → max 10 named people; deduplicate

6. Pain signal extraction (Section 8)
   → regex pass over careers-page + LinkedIn director posts for:
     - urgency phrases ("rapid growth", "scaling fast", "we need", "tripling", "doubling")
     - frustration phrases (Glassdoor if accessible: "overworked", "burnout", "no support")
     - hiring-pressure phrases ("desperately seeking", "high-priority hire", "must hire by")
   → record each match with quote + source URL + context

7. ICP fit scoring (Section 6)
   → load tenant target_patch from common-target-patch.json
   → score each dimension (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band)
   → composite score 0-100 + per-dimension breakdown
   → no external action; compute only

8. Recent activity scan (Section 10)
   → LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + first 100 chars of each)
   → basic Google search for "{firm} announcement OR funding OR acquisition" last 90 days
   → Companies House filing history last 90 days

9. Conversation opener generation (Section 12)
   → LLM prompt: context = §1-§11 of the report (esp. §8 pain signals);
                 constraint = consultant voice (hh_load_voice_samples for top-5 ANN match);
                 constraint = tone rules (hh_load_tone_rules)
   → output 2-3 sentences with at least one evidence anchor
   → voice classifier scores the output against tenant style guide
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score < 0.75 after 3 retries

10. Markdown report assembly
    → render report from sections 1-12 using Diagnostic-specific template
    → write to /vault/{tenant_slug}/diagnostic-reports/{firm-slug}-{ISO-date}.md
    → hh_decision_output("diagnostic_report", "<path>", "12-section report on {firm}")

11. Operator notification (optional, per --notify-via flag)
    → if telegram: send via primitive 5 with report path + executive summary (first 200 chars)
    → if no flag: silent completion (consultant checks vault)

12. Session close
    → hh_decision_action("diagnostic_report_render", "firm:{slug}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
    → action tier per autosend-policy.yaml: green (no external send; vault write only)
    → exit code 0
```

---

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces:

- All 12 sections present in the assembled report (count + heading check)
- Every section has ≥ 1 markdown link (regex `\[.+\]\(.+\)` per section)
- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3)
- Report length 400-2000 words
- No banned phrases per `tone_rule` table (`hh_load_tone_rules` filter)
- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by tagging the report's outcome in `decision_log.payload.gate_b_outcome` when the consultant updates status (via Telegram or Brain UI v1.1).

Gate B doesn't block the agent — it's the v1.0 kill criterion §2 Trigger 5 metric. Below 30% sustained for 4 weeks → revisit Diagnostic's output quality.

## §6 — Escalation codes

Diagnostic uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Section 12 voice classifier < 0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Companies House or LinkedIn 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` | Section count != 12 OR malformed input | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` | (not Diagnostic's concern; renderer escalation only) | — | — |

Diagnostic does NOT use:

- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)
- `ESC_VAULT_*` — Diagnostic writes to one file per invocation; no concurrent-write contention

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Section 12 (conversation opener) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `diagnostic`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "I hope this finds you well" or other generic openers
  - No salary or commission anchors in cold outreach
  - Specific evidence anchor required (not generic "great company")
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant's voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks closest to current task context (cold-outreach-to-recruitment-firm-decision-maker). Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. If drift is detected (edit-distance > 200 chars on >50% of recent_edit rows), `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires (per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5).

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W3 prerequisites)

Diagnostic build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 commits | ✅ Ratified (Round 3) |
| Live VPS migration applied | `bash scripts/run-live-migration.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Tenancy audit passes 12 invariants | `bash scripts/run-tenancy-audit.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Q1 design partner LOI signed | Risk #3 + kill-criterion §2 Trigger 1 | ⏸ Jack's lane |
| `target_patch.json` for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI (per tenant-lifecycle.md §2) |
| Voice corpus seeded for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Companies House MCP connector | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| LinkedIn read-only MCP connector (or Proxycurl wrapper) | Build at W3 start (~2 days) | ⏸ Not built |
| Web scraper utility (HEAD + first-N-lines) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic (12-section check) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs (01-primary + 02-edge-case-no-online-footprint + 99-voice-drift-canary) | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| Codex ratification of full agent bundle | Post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill | ⏸ Skill not built yet (lazy per execution plan §3) |

**Until ALL ratified items have ⏸ → ✅, W3 build slice does not start.**

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + first pilot tenant onboarded + W3 build slice start.

**Recommended ratification path:** Author the agent.md draft (this document) Day 11 — frees W3 build to focus on the other 5 bundle files + 3 fixtures, not iterating on output contract under W3 deadline pressure. Founder reviews this draft when convenient; refinements drop in commits between Day 11 and W3 start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
| Q2 | Should §11 (decision-maker map) be a separate section OR rolled into §3 + §4 + §5 + §7 as a sub-row? Currently named as a separate section. | Founder review at agent.md ratification. |
| Q3 | Proxycurl vs alternative LinkedIn API surface? Cost + ToS implications. | Resolved at W3 start before Companies House + LinkedIn MCP connectors authored. Founder + Claude decide together. |
| Q4 | Gate B (30% discovery-call-to-report ratio) measured how? Manual tagging by consultant OR auto-detection via Bullhorn calendar links? | v1.0 manual tagging via Telegram resolution; v1.1 auto-detection. |
| Q5 | What's the "firm-slug" canonical form for the output filename? Companies House registration number? URL-slugified firm name? | Recommend Companies House number for stability; canonical-slug fallback for non-UK firms (v1.1+). |
| Q6 | Should §10 (recent activity) include Glassdoor reviews? ToS implications. | Per gotcha §6 below: caution; default OFF for v1.0; explicit founder enable for v1.1+. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)

1. **LinkedIn ToS — cannot store profile data beyond the audit.** Profile fetches are cached only for the duration of the report generation (typ. 10-15 min). After report writes to vault, raw profile data is dropped from agent memory + no persistence in Postgres.
2. **Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.** Free tier is 600 requests per 5-minute window per IP. Cache responses for 7 days per (company_number) key. Pre-emptive 60s backoff on first 429.
3. **Glassdoor scraping — uncertain ToS compatibility.** Default OFF for v1.0. Per Q6 above.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (skill not yet built; lazy per execution-plan §3): this agent.md plus the 5 sibling bundle files plus 3 fixtures ratify as a unit at W3 build end.

Status flips to Accepted when:
- Codex Round-3+ ratifies the full bundle
- Founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical
- First production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Gate B baseline measurement begins (30% target; 4-week window)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.
