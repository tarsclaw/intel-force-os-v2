=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/janitor/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Janitor — the wedge agent

**Status:** Proposed (Day-16 pre-W5-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted + W5 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A2 line 503 (ULTRAPLAN says week 5-6, master brief says week 5; master brief is authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 512.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (scheduled nightly cron; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 504 + sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Janitor produces TWO outputs per nightly cron run:** (1) a Markdown day-30 cleanup report at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md` documenting all data-hygiene actions taken in the prior 30 days, and (2) a stream of yellow-tier writes to the tenant's Bullhorn ATS that (a) merge high-confidence duplicate candidate records, (b) backfill missing field values via Companies House enrichment, and (c) attach tacit notes harvested from `decision_log` resolution events. Cron fires at 02:00 UTC daily; the day-30 report regenerates on the 1st of each month rolling. Gate A hard-fails any merge proposal with confidence <0.85 (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510). Gate B success threshold: the day-30 report shows ≥15% dedup rate improvement AND ≥10% field-completeness improvement vs the day-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511). All Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` (sampled spot-checks; no synchronous approval; per-write audit row to `decision_log` with `agent_name='janitor'`).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Cron (v1.0)

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/ifos-janitor → calls this script per tenant
0 2 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-janitor.sh --tenant <slug>
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Janitor in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY). Typical runtime per tenant: 15-45 min depending on Bullhorn corpus size.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — operator convenience)

```bash
ifosctl janitor --tenant <slug> [--dry-run] [--report-only]
```

`--dry-run` reports what WOULD be written without touching Bullhorn. `--report-only` regenerates the day-30 report without doing dedup/enrichment passes (used post-incident for manual report regeneration).

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Run Janitor now" button → triggers via internal API
- Tenant-admin override for dedup confidence threshold (default 0.85; per-tenant via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`)

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per run. Both are load-bearing artefacts.

### Output 1 — Day-30 Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md`. Eight sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record counts** | Total candidates / contractors / clients / contacts / placements / opportunities before + after this run; deltas per entity type |
| 2 | **Dedup pairs** | List of duplicate candidate pairs identified this run (confidence ≥0.85 only); for each pair: CRNs, match dimensions (name + email + phone + LinkedIn), confidence score, action taken (merged vs flagged-for-review) |
| 3 | **Field-completeness deltas** | Per entity-type table: which fields were filled in (e.g., candidate.location, contractor.day_rate); source of the backfill (Companies House lookup, LinkedIn enrichment, derivation from related entities) |
| 4 | **Tacit-note coverage** | Notes harvested from `decision_log` resolved with `outcome='approved_after_edit'` per master brief §8.1 Change 2; attached to relevant Bullhorn entities; coverage rate over the 30-day window |
| 5 | **Agent vs. consultant attribution** | Rows attributed to Janitor automated work vs consultant manual entry; supports the day-30 before/after narrative |
| 6 | **Gate-B metric** | Composite score: (dedup % improvement × 0.5) + (field-completeness % improvement × 0.5). Target ≥12.5 (≥15% dedup + ≥10% field) per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 |
| 7 | **Exception list** | Failed writes (Bullhorn 4xx/5xx, FK violations); rate-limit hits; dedup proposals flagged for review (confidence between 0.7-0.85); operator action items |
| 8 | **Executive summary** | 200-word narrative suitable for forwarding to the tenant's hiring leader; cites top-3 cleanup wins; quantifies time saved (hours of consultant data-entry work avoided) |

### Output 2 — Bullhorn writes (yellow tier)

Per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml` row `janitor_bullhorn_write`. Three write categories:

1. **Candidate merge** (`PUT /Candidate/{primary_id}` + cascade) — only when confidence ≥0.85 per Gate A; no merge if either candidate had Bullhorn activity in last 90 days without explicit review flag (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim).
2. **Field backfill** (`PATCH /Candidate/{id}` or `/Client/{id}`) — fills missing `location`, `industry`, `last_active_date`, etc. from Companies House (for clients) or LinkedIn/derivation (for candidates). Sources logged in payload.
3. **Tacit-note attach** (`POST /Note` linked to entity) — narrative summary of consultant edits + decision-log resolutions over the 30-day window.

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='janitor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='bullhorn_candidate_merge' | 'bullhorn_field_backfill' | 'bullhorn_note_attach'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes source confidence + provenance.

---

## §4 — Workflow

12 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice corpus
     (used for tacit-note attribution) + recent edits (for note harvest)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "janitor nightly cron")

1. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
     (bullhorn-integration-path.md §4.5)
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

2. Bullhorn entity scan (read-only)
   → enumerate candidates + contractors + clients + contacts + placements +
     opportunities created/modified since last Janitor run (last_run_at in
     tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run)
   → hh_decision_output("janitor_scan", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> entities scanned")
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Bullhorn 429 (60s backoff per §1.1.2 of v0.2 supplement)

3. Dedup pass — candidate entity type
   → fuzzy-match across (name, email, phone, linkedin_url) tuples
   → compute confidence per pair: name × 0.3 + email × 0.4 + phone × 0.2 + linkedin × 0.1
   → discard pairs <0.85 confidence (per Gate A)
   → discard pairs where EITHER candidate has Bullhorn activity in last 90d
     (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
   → batch into proposed-merge list

4. Dedup pass — contractor entity type
   → same algorithm as candidates; separate entity_type per Q1 Day-6 resolution
     (vertical-schema.yaml §1)

5. Field completeness audit
   → for each entity, check critical fields: candidate.location, client.industry,
     client.headcount_band, contractor.day_rate, brief.salary_band
   → identify missing-field rows
   → batch enrichment calls

6. Companies House enrichment (clients only)
   → companies_house.search(client.legal_name) → CRN → profile → fill industry +
     registered_office_address + sic_codes
   → 7-day cache per tools.yaml; rate-limit budget shared with Diagnostic
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on 429

7. LinkedIn enrichment (candidates; v1.1 via Proxycurl)
   → at v1.0: skipped (LinkedIn deep data deferred to W4 polish; Proxycurl
     signup commercial decision)
   → at v1.1: linkedin.profile_fetch(candidate.linkedin_url) → location +
     current_company → write back

8. Tacit-note harvest
   → query decision_log for recent_edit rows in last 30 days for this tenant
     where resolution='approved_after_edit'
   → group by target_entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / etc.)
   → for each group, generate narrative summary via voice-classified LLM
     (voice corpus + tone rules; ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75)

9. Bullhorn write batch (yellow tier — spot-check sampling)
   → for each proposed merge / backfill / note: emit hh_decision_action with
     tier='yellow'; spot-check sample rate per autosend-policy.yaml row
   → atomic per-write transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT)
   → on 4xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; skip; continue
   → on 5xx: emit ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; retry once with 30s backoff

10. Day-30 report assembly
   → SELECT from decision_log WHERE agent_name='janitor' AND created_at >
     now() - interval '30 days' AND tenant_slug=$tenant
   → group by action_type; tally success/fail; compute Gate-B metric
   → 8-section Markdown report (per §3 above)
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/janitor-reports/day-30-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("day_30_report", "<path>", "Gate-B score: <N>")

11. Operator notification (Telegram)
   → if Gate-B target met: green-tier notification with summary
   → if Gate-B target missed: yellow-tier notification + 200-char executive
     summary suggesting consultant follow-up

12. Session close
   → update tenant_adapters.config.janitor_last_run = now()
   → hh_decision_action("janitor_run_complete", "tenant:<slug>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → exit code 0 (or 1 if Gate-B missed for 3 consecutive runs → ESC_GATE_B_MISS)
```

---

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Janitor's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded in Step 1 (no stale token writes)
- Every proposed merge has confidence ≥ 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510
- No merge proposal where EITHER candidate has activity (placement / interview / note) in last 90 days (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510 verbatim)
- No field-backfill where source confidence <0.7 (CH 404 / LinkedIn empty / no derivation source)
- Tacit-note narratives pass voice classifier ≥ 0.75
- Bullhorn write batch size ≤ 100 per minute (rate-limit defensive)
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narratives (regex pass)

Gate A failures fire `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` + draft report stays in `/tmp` (not vault); operator-review required.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 511 verbatim: **"day-30 before/after report shows ≥15% dedup, ≥10% field completeness improvement"**.

Composite score = (dedup% × 0.5) + (field-completeness% × 0.5). Target ≥12.5.

Gate B doesn't block the agent. It's the v1.0 kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 supporting metric ("Gate-B revenue uplift" — Janitor's day-30 report is THE artefact that demonstrates "DSO drops" / "consultant time saved" claims to the FD-tier closer).

Below ≥12.5 for 3 consecutive runs → fire `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → flag for operator review (heuristic tuning may be needed; not a kill).

## §6 — Escalation codes

Janitor uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on merge/backfill/note write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or Companies House 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note narrative voice classifier <0.75 (after 3 retries) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected in tacit-note outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` | Gate A failure (merge confidence + activity window + field-source confidence) | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Composite Gate-B score <12.5 for 3 consecutive runs | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_YELLOW_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Janitor does NOT use:

- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — that's for cross-tenant voice drift; Janitor is per-tenant
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's red-tier; Janitor doesn't do red writes
- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated from `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` after 6 consecutive auth failures (different code; Concierge handles)

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (tacit-note narrative generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `janitor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about candidates beyond what's in their CV / Bullhorn record
  - No commercial sensitive information (rates / placement fees / commission %)
  - No external-party PII (clients of clients)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal note summary" task context. Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `janitor` agent**: detects if consultants are heavily editing Janitor's tacit-note drafts. Drift >200 chars on >50% of recent_edit rows fires `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT`.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W5 prerequisites)

Janitor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ Week 3 in progress |
| First pilot tenant onboarded (provision-tenant.sh) | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ Founder action; Trigger 1 fires 2026-06-03 if no LOI |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision A Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ Form submitted 2026-05-24; 2-5 business days |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decision B Accepted** | Bullhorn developer support routing | ⏸ Same |
| Bullhorn MCP connector built | W3-W4 conditional (per ADR-005 sequencing) | ⏸ Not started |
| Bullhorn client_id + client_secret obtained | Tenant pilot OAuth ticket (or marketplace credentials if A=marketplace) | ⏸ Post-A+B Accept |
| Companies House MCP connector | Day-13 shipped (`@ifos/companies-house`) | ✅ |
| Tenant `target_patch.json` + `_secrets.env` provisioned | provision-tenant.sh ran for first pilot | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W5 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (12-step) | Build at W5 start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Dedup heuristic + confidence scorer | Build at W5 start (~3 days) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W5 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W5 build slice does not start.** Per kill-criterion §2 Trigger 3 (JANITOR-BULLHORN-AUTH-W5): if Bullhorn auth not cleared by end of W5, Janitor + Scribe defer to W7-8 per ULTRAPLAN §10 Risk #2 contingency.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B Accepted + Q1 LOI + W5 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Dedup confidence threshold default — 0.85 per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 510, but should this be per-tenant overridable via `tenant_adapters.config.janitor_dedup_threshold`? | Founder review at agent.md ratification. Recommend: default 0.85; per-tenant override [0.75, 0.95]. |
| Q2 | Field-completeness priority order — which missing fields are highest-impact to backfill first? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant focus (perm vs contract). |
| Q3 | Bullhorn write batch size — current default 100/min. Bullhorn published rate-limit isn't documented; we may need to negotiate. | Bullhorn commercial conversation Sub-decision B output. |
| Q4 | Tacit-note attribution — should notes attribute to "Intel Force OS Janitor" or just "Internal note"? Tenant brand preference. | Per-tenant config at first-pilot onboarding. |
| Q5 | Day-30 report distribution path — vault only OR also forwarded to tenant's hiring leader via email? | v1.0: vault only. v1.1: opt-in email forward via Concierge. |
| Q6 | Gate B exception handling — what if a tenant's day-0 baseline is already exceptionally clean (low headroom for improvement)? | Founder review at first 3-tenant cohort; may need per-tenant Gate B calibration. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513)

1. **Bullhorn MCP server doesn't exist yet — this is the critical-path build for v1.0.** Estimate 1 week for the MCP server, 1 week for the agent itself (per ULTRAPLAN A2 line 513).
2. **Dedup is hard; start conservative.** High-confidence merges only (≥0.85); tune up the threshold over time as data builds.
3. **Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy** (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569 — Concierge note applies cross-agent). Janitor relies on polling not webhooks; safer for nightly cron pattern.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-architecture-decision.md` skill: this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted (pre-build) when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 open questions Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6
- Q3 resolves via Bullhorn Sub-decision B answer

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W5 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production run against migration-test tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Day-30 baseline measured for first pilot tenant
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.
