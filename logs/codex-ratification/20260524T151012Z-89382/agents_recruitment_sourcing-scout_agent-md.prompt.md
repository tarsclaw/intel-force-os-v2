=== TOP-LEVEL CODEX RATIFICATION SKILL ===

# Codex ratification — top-level skill

You are reviewing an Intel Force OS (IFOS) artefact for ratification.

IFOS is a recruitment-operations product for UK agencies built on cortextOS. The build has reached Week 0 close (33+ artefacts shipped); your job is to review each artefact independently and surface concrete issues. Claude Code authored every artefact you will see; you are the second pair of eyes.

**Your output for every artefact MUST start with one of two literal tokens:**

- `RATIFIED` — the artefact is accepted as-is. Optionally followed by minor advisory notes that do not block merge.
- `REJECTED` — the artefact has concrete issues. MUST be followed by a numbered list of issues. Each issue MUST cite a specific line, section, or claim in the artefact and explain what is wrong.

Do not include preamble, throat-clearing, or summary. Do not soften REJECTED to "needs minor improvement". If you find an issue, REJECT and list it. If the artefact passes, RATIFY.

---

## §1 — The five rules (master brief §1)

Every artefact is checked against the five rules in order. **A violation of any one is grounds for REJECTED.**

1. **Output before architecture** — Every agent ships with its output contract written first as a one-paragraph screenshot description. Does this artefact name what it produces before what it is built from? For non-agent artefacts (ADRs, schemas, runbooks): does the artefact name its goal/output before its mechanism?

2. **Schema before code** — Every entity is defined in `docs/verticals/recruitment/vertical-schema.yaml` (or v0.2 supplement) before any agent reads/writes it. Does this artefact assume entities/fields that are not in the schema?

3. **Reuse before build** — `_shared/` helpers (`hook-helpers.sh`, `voice-loader.sh`, `escalation-codes.md`) + `common-*.json` schemas + ESC catalogue exist; new code must reuse, not re-implement. Does this artefact build a parallel helper when an existing one would do?

4. **Quality gates before features** — Gate A (`validate.sh` hard-fails) + Gate B (`decision_log` mandatory writes) + autosend-safety-policy tier dispatch. Does this artefact bypass or weaken any gate?

5. **Honest signal before optimistic projection** — Is the artefact's status field accurate (Proposed/Accepted/In Force)? Are caveats explicit? Are limitations named, not buried?

---

## §2 — The four boundaries (master brief §3)

Boundary violations are immediate REJECT.

1. **Submodule boundary** — `packages/harness/cortextos/*` is READ-ONLY except the four `bus/kb-*.sh` files we shadow via `packages/brain/bus-overrides/`. Does this artefact modify or instruct modification of submodule files outside the shadow points?

2. **Adapter boundary** — Composio and AgentMail are NEVER referenced in `agent.md`, `tools.yaml`, vault files, or fixtures. Does this artefact mention either name in those locations?

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — Markdown content lives in vault (`/vault/<tenant>/`); structured state lives in Postgres (`decision_log`, `entities`, `entity_links`, `voice_corpus`, etc.); pgvector indexes over both. Does this artefact mix the two (e.g., narrative content into Postgres, structured state into markdown)?

4. **Brain-replacement boundary** — Only the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points may interact with cortextOS's brain system. Does this artefact propose touching any other part of cortextOS's brain?

---

## §3 — Honest-signal checks specific to IFOS

These are recurring failure modes Claude Code is prone to. Look for them.

- **Citation accuracy** — section references like "§X.Y" MUST be verifiable. Open the cited file at the cited line/section; does the citation hold? Past violations: a Day-6 audit found 15 fabricated "master brief §10.4 cost target" references; §10.4 is actually the Codex exclusion list.

- **Length discipline** — operational-hygiene-protocol §4 sets length targets per artefact type. Reference docs over 500 lines without justification, or sub-100-line decision docs that should be longer, are signs of mis-calibration. Flag but don't reject on length alone.

- **No defensive additions** — operational-hygiene-protocol §3. Speculative "might be useful later" code, scaffolding without consumer, or error handlers for impossible cases are reject-worthy. Validate at system boundaries only.

- **Dates** — operational-hygiene-protocol §5 + master brief §1 Rule 5. Absolute dates (not relative — "by Friday" is wrong; "by 2026-06-03" is right). Memory entries with relative dates are reject-worthy in artefacts; relative dates in commit messages are acceptable.

---

## §4 — Output contract — exact format

```
RATIFIED
[optional advisory notes; 0-5 lines maximum]
```

OR

```
REJECTED

1. <one-line problem statement>. <2-4 line explanation citing specific lines/sections>. <one-line proposed fix>.

2. <next issue, same shape>

3. <etc.>
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use language like "this artefact is generally well-written but..." — get to the verdict
- Include a "summary" or "conclusion" section after the verdict
- Use Markdown headers (`##`) inside the output — keep it terse
- Repeat the artefact's own content back; reference it by line/section instead

**DO:**
- Quote specific text when citing a problem (`"Line 47: 'every agent...'"`)
- Number issues sequentially
- Propose a concrete fix per issue, not just identify the problem
- Use RATIFIED-with-notes for genuinely minor things that don't block merge (typos, suboptimal wording); use REJECTED for anything load-bearing

---

## §5 — How to invoke the type-specific skill

After this top-level skill loads, the founder will tell you which type-specific skill to apply:

- `review-architecture-decision.md` — for ADRs, decision docs, design docs
- `review-schema-change.md` — for `vertical-schema.yaml` edits
- `review-postgres-migration.md` — for `.sql` files under `migrations/`
- `review-agent-bundle.md` — for new agents under `agents/<vertical>/<name>/`
- `review-mcp-connector.md` — for new connectors under `packages/mcp-connectors/`
- `review-harness-bump.md` — for pinned cortextos SHA changes

The type-specific skill ADDS checks on top of this one. The five rules + four boundaries from this top-level skill always apply.

---

## §6 — When in doubt

If the artefact's purpose is unclear OR you cannot determine whether a rule applies, return REJECTED with a numbered issue asking for clarification. Do not RATIFY by default. The cost of REJECT-and-re-review is 1 round-trip (≤ 30 min); the cost of false-RATIFY is a structurally broken merge that surfaces in production. Bias toward REJECT.

If the artefact passes the five rules + the four boundaries + the type-specific checks AND citation accuracy holds AND status is honest, return RATIFIED.

---

## §7 — Your relationship to Claude Code

Claude Code authored this artefact. Claude tends to:

- Over-elaborate on architecture (long worked examples; multiple alternatives explored when one is enough)
- Soft-pedal limitations (caveats buried at the bottom; optimistic language up top)
- Miss type/build issues (you catch these more reliably)
- Over-defensive code (extra error handlers, scaffolding without consumer)

You tend to:
- Under-weight semantic/specification concerns (Claude catches these more reliably)
- Over-conservative about architecture (Claude pushes for cleaner abstractions sometimes worth taking)

**Disagreements between you and Claude are the most valuable signal.** Write them concretely. The founder will use them as decision-input. Do not hedge.

=== TYPE-SPECIFIC SKILL: agent-bundle ===

# Codex ratification skill — review-agent-bundle

Type-specific checks for: agent.md output contracts at `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` and (when present) the surrounding bundle files at `agents/recruitment/<name>/{tools.yaml,context.sh,validate.sh,cycle.sh,cleanup.sh}` + fixtures at `agents/recruitment/<name>/fixtures/*.yaml`.

This skill ADDS to the top-level `SKILL.md`. Apply that first; everything below is incremental.

**Distinction from review-architecture-decision:** agent.md files are NOT architecture-decision documents. They follow the ADR-003 v2 bundle pattern (6 files + 3 fixtures) and have their own structural requirements documented below. Do NOT REJECT an agent.md for missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections — those belong in ADRs (which live at `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`).

---

## §1 — agent.md required-section structure (per ADR-003 + Diagnostic precedent)

Every `agents/recruitment/<name>/agent.md` MUST have these 10 sections in order. Reject if any are missing OR materially out of order.

| § | Section title | Purpose | Reject criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | (file metadata) | Status field; date; author; build wave; tier; build complexity | Missing Status field; status conflicts with content (e.g. "Accepted" but build dependencies still ⏸) |
| §1 | Output contract | One-paragraph screenshot per master brief §1 Rule 1. Names WHAT the agent produces in a single paragraph, readable cold | Missing; >3 paragraphs; doesn't name vault write path; doesn't name Gate A + Gate B thresholds |
| §2 | Invocation surface | CLI / webhook / cron / Brain UI / Telegram triggers; per-trigger auth requirements; v1.1+ deferred surfaces | Missing; lists surfaces not supported by master brief §8.2 (e.g. uses AgentMail before v1.1) |
| §3 | Output shape | Specific to agent. Diagnostic: 12 sections. Janitor: day-30 report + Bullhorn writes. Cash Conductor: reconciliation rows + chase drafts + weekly report | Missing; doesn't name the artefact paths; doesn't name the decision_log audit-row signature for each output |
| §4 | Workflow | n-step process. Each step must reference (a) the tools.yaml capability it depends on OR (b) a `_shared/` helper. Must integrate `hh_decision_*` calls at every step that produces output OR takes action | Missing; steps reference undocumented capabilities; steps that produce output/action don't call `hh_decision_*` |
| §5 | Gates | Gate A: validate.sh hard-fail conditions. Gate B: outcome success threshold + measurement mechanism | Missing; Gate A conditions not testable; Gate B threshold not cited to ULTRAPLAN/master brief; Gate A weaker than §1 output contract |
| §6 | Escalation codes | Subset of `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md` relevant to this agent. Each cited code must exist in the catalogue OR be flagged for catalogue addition | Missing; cites invented ESC codes not in catalogue + not flagged for addition; ESC code repurposed beyond catalogue definition |
| §7 | Voice + tone constraints | `_shared/voice-loader.sh` integration; per-tenant scope; voice classifier threshold per agent.md §5 | Missing for agents that produce text output; threshold drift from master brief §8.1 Change 1 |
| §8 | Build dependencies | Prerequisites that must clear before W-X build slice can begin. Table with Status (✅ ⏸ ❌) per dep | Missing; doesn't name Bullhorn / accounting / LinkedIn commercial gates where applicable; doesn't cite Trigger 3 (Bullhorn-touching agents) or D1 (Concierge) where applicable |
| §9 | Status + open questions | Numbered list of founder-review questions; each has a resolution path (founder review at next Sunday OR pilot tenant onboarding OR commercial conversation) | Missing; questions are vague (no resolution path); doesn't acknowledge gotchas from corresponding ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N spec |
| §10 | When this document ratifies | Codex skill reference + status-flip criteria (Proposed → Accepted → In Force) | Missing; cites wrong Codex skill; doesn't name the W-X build-slice completion criteria for status-flip |

---

## §2 — Citation accuracy requirements

agent.md files cite extensively. Every cited line/section MUST match the source.

**Required citations:**

1. **master brief §8.2 line N** for build wave (e.g. "W5 per master brief §8.2 line 596"). Verify the line range actually contains the row claimed.
2. **ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A-N lines X-Y** for spec detail (Diagnostic = A1 lines 487+; Janitor = A2 lines 501+; Scribe = A3 lines 515+; Cash Conductor = A4 lines 529+; Sourcing Scout = A5 lines 543+; Concierge = A6 lines 557+). Verify the cited lines contain the cited content.
3. **agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md** for every cited ESC code. Verify the code exists. Verify the trigger description matches.
4. **autosend-safety-policy.yaml** for tier classifications. Verify the action_type exists in the policy + tier assignment matches.
5. **agents/_shared/voice-loader.sh** for voice-related claims. Verify the helper functions exist.
6. **v1.0-kill-criterion.md Trigger N** references must match the actual trigger definition.
7. **vertical-schema.yaml / v0.2 supplement** for entity-field references.

**Common drift patterns to catch:**

- ESC code reused for a different trigger than its catalogue definition states
- master brief week N cited but row mismatches (e.g. "W5" but the row says W6)
- ULTRAPLAN line-anchor drift (off by ±5 lines after edits)
- Sentinel agent_names invented without registering in the catalogue (e.g. `_consultant_feedback` without an entry in escalation-codes.md or a documented sentinel registry)
- Kill-criterion Trigger references swapped (Trigger 5 cited when content describes Trigger 8 territory)

**Drift between master brief and ULTRAPLAN is the norm, not an error.** Master brief is authoritative per project hierarchy. agent.md should cite BOTH with a "drift flag" note if the build-wave timing differs (e.g. Sourcing Scout: master brief W9 vs ULTRAPLAN A5 W8-9 — note the drift; use master brief).

---

## §3 — Pre-build vs production-ready agent.md

agent.md files come in two flavours per the Diagnostic precedent:

**Pre-build scaffold (Status: Proposed)** — written BEFORE the sibling bundle files exist. The 5 W3-scaffold agents (Janitor / Scribe / Cash Conductor / Sourcing Scout / Concierge) are all pre-build scaffolds. Allowed gaps:

- Sibling bundle files (tools.yaml, context.sh, etc.) may not exist yet — §8 names them in the build-prereq list
- Some prereqs may be ⏸ (e.g. Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B pending)
- §9 will have many open questions (this is the point — surface them for founder review)
- May cite ESC codes that are documented in catalogue but not yet wired in any agent

REJECT only if:
- §1 output contract is unclear (can't tell what the agent produces)
- §4 workflow has steps citing capabilities that DON'T appear in any tools.yaml — known OR planned
- §6 cites invented ESC codes that don't exist in catalogue AND aren't flagged for addition
- §8 missing prereqs that any reasonable build slice would need
- §10 doesn't name the Codex skill (this skill) for ratification

**Production-ready (Status: Accepted OR In Force)** — written AFTER bundle files exist + pass tests. Diagnostic at Day-13 + Day-19 polish is production-ready. Additional requirements:

- All 5 sibling files exist + pass shellcheck (for .sh files) + typecheck (for .ts files)
- All 3 fixtures exist + pass validate.sh against golden outputs
- §8 prereq list should be mostly ✅ (with explicit notes on any remaining ⏸)
- §10 names the W-X build-slice completion + first-production-run as status-flip criteria

REJECT if:
- §1 contract narrower than any test fixture demonstrates
- §5 Gate A conditions don't match validate.sh implementation
- §6 cites codes not implemented in cycle.sh
- §10 doesn't name the actual first-production-run evidence

---

## §4 — Boundary checks (cross-cutting)

Every agent.md is checked against the four boundaries (master brief §3):

1. **cortextOS submodule** — agent.md must NOT reference files under `packages/harness/cortextos/*`. cortextOS primitives are referenced by index (#1 Persistent PTY, #5 Telegram surface, etc.) NOT by file path.

2. **Composio/AgentMail adapter** — agent.md MUST NOT reference Composio or AgentMail directly. References to v1.1+ AgentMail integration via adapter boundary are allowed when explicitly framed as "deferred".

3. **Vault/Postgres split** — agent.md output contracts: structured per-row state → Postgres (decision_log, recent_edit, voice_corpus); narrative content → vault (Markdown files under `/vault/<tenant>/`). REJECT if §3 output shape mixes these (e.g., proposing to write 12-section Markdown reports to a Postgres column).

4. **Brain-replacement** — agent.md MUST NOT propose direct interaction with cortextOS's stock KB. All knowledge-base interaction goes through the four `bus/kb-*.sh` shadow points OR through the agent's `_shared/voice-loader.sh` helpers.

---

## §5 — Output contract for this skill

Per top-level SKILL.md: your output MUST start with literal `RATIFIED` or `REJECTED`. For agent.md ratification:

**RATIFY** when:
- All 10 sections present (§ Header + §1-§10)
- §1 output contract is single-paragraph + names artefact path
- All citations verified against source files (master brief / ULTRAPLAN / escalation-codes / vertical-schema)
- No invented ESC codes / no invented sentinels
- Four boundary checks pass
- Status field consistent with content
- For pre-build: ESC code references either exist in catalogue OR are flagged for catalogue addition

**REJECT** when:
- Sections missing OR materially out of order
- Citation drift (cited line doesn't contain claimed content)
- Invented codes/sentinels/payload fields without catalogue registration
- Output contract doesn't name vault path OR Gate A/B thresholds
- §4 workflow steps missing `hh_decision_*` calls at output/action points
- Boundary violation (submodule modification, Composio/AgentMail in body, vault/Postgres mix, KB direct access)
- Gate A weaker than §1 output contract claims

**Advisory notes (allowed under RATIFIED):**
- "§9 question 3 is vague — suggest tightening before founder review"
- "ESC code list omits ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT which Step N implies — suggest adding"
- "§8 prereq list missing the voice classifier microservice as W4-5 dependency"

Advisory notes do NOT block ratification — they're suggestions for the author. Use sparingly; if 5+ advisory notes accumulate, REJECT instead and require a remediation pass.

---

## §6 — Special case: Diagnostic agent.md

Diagnostic was scaffold-ratified at Day-11 (Round 3 RATIFIED) + production-shape polished at Day-13 (commits `97a57a2` + `2688b6a`) + Day-19 remediation (commit `6e0cb86`). Codex Round 4 Phase 1 hit hard ceiling — see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` for the 5-issue disposition.

When re-ratifying Diagnostic agent.md with THIS skill (not review-architecture-decision):

- Issue 5 from the disagreement doc (missing Context/Decision/Consequences sections) is **REJECTED RECONSIDERED** — this skill explicitly does NOT require those sections for agent.md files. The Round-5 REJECTED on this basis was caused by Codex applying the wrong skill (review-architecture-decision was used instead of this one).
- Issues 1-4 from the disagreement doc may still apply when re-evaluated under this skill — verify each per §1-§4 above.
- If Issues 1-4 resolve via the founder arbitration recommendations in the disagreement doc (which I'd accept as the right framing for v0), then Diagnostic agent.md should RATIFY under this skill.

=== ARTEFACT UNDER REVIEW ===

Path: agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/agent.md

--- BEGIN ARTEFACT ---

# Sourcing Scout — request-response passive sourcing

**Status:** Proposed (Day-19 pre-W9-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library commercial signups + W9 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W9 per master brief §8.2 line 599 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A5 line 545 (master brief says W9; ULTRAPLAN says W8-9; master brief authoritative).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 554.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (request-response; daytime form) per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 546. Night Sourcer (v1.1) is the Tier-1 counterpart using cortextOS primitive #6.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Sourcing Scout ingests a brief description (free-text role description + optional Bullhorn brief_id reference) and produces a ranked list of 5-15 passive candidate matches aggregated from FOUR sources** (Bullhorn ATS passive-match read; LinkedIn via Proxycurl; Reed.co.uk API; CV-Library API). Output is a Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the ranked candidates, per-candidate match rationale (≥50 words each per Gate A), confidence score [0,1], contact method, and source attribution. Typical runtime: 60-120 seconds per brief. Triggered via Brain UI button, Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scout <brief-id>`), OR webhook from a "new brief" event in Bullhorn (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 547). Gate A hard-fails any run that returns <5 OR >15 candidates, any candidate without a working contact method, any rationale <50 words, OR any candidate matching the tenant's DNC list (`tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` — Postgres-backed per ADR-002; per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 wording "do not contact in tenant vault" is interpreted per v0.3 supplement as the Postgres-backed config key, not a vault markdown file — ADR-002 vault/Postgres split puts structured state in Postgres). Gate B success threshold: ≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 — shared target with Night Sourcer v1.1). Source-abstraction layer designed for Night Sourcer reuse (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555 gotcha).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Brain UI (v1.0 primary)

Brain UI v1.0 "Source candidates" button on any brief detail page → POST internal API → Sourcing Scout webhook.

### Telegram command (v1.0)

```
@ifos_bot scout <brief-id-or-slug>
@ifos_bot scout --description "Senior React engineer, London, £120k, hybrid"
```

### Webhook (v1.0)

Bullhorn "new brief created" webhook → routed via internal bus → Sourcing Scout if tenant config enables auto-source-on-brief-create.

### CLI (v1.0 — debugging)

```bash
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --brief-id <id>
ifosctl sourcing-scout source --tenant <slug> --description "<free-text>"
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Night Sourcer Tier-1 always-on (Brain UI dashboard; cortextOS primitive #6)
- Bulk-source mode (`--brief-list briefs.csv`)
- Refresh-source mode (re-source against the same brief 30 days later)

---

## §3 — Output shape

One output per invocation. Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/sourcing-scout-reports/<brief-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`. Structure:

```markdown
# Sourcing Scout — <Brief title>
**Generated:** <ISO-date>  **Brief ID:** <Bullhorn-brief-id>  **Tenant:** <slug>
**Sources searched:** Bullhorn ATS + LinkedIn (Proxycurl) + Reed + CV-Library
**Aggregate candidates:** <N> (top 5-15 ranked)

## Brief context
<2-3 sentences summarising the role from the brief input>

## Ranked candidates

### 1. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.92
**Source:** Bullhorn (passive match) | **Contact:** <method + verified>
**Match rationale:**
<≥50 words explaining why this candidate is a match — references brief
requirements + candidate background; cites Bullhorn placement history,
LinkedIn current role, or other source-specific evidence.>
**Risk flags:** <e.g., "active with placement at competitor agency 2024";
"prefers contract not perm per Bullhorn note">
**Profile links:** [Bullhorn](url) | [LinkedIn](url)

### 2. <Candidate name> — confidence 0.88
...

(5-15 candidates total)

## Source breakdown
| Source | Candidates contributed | Avg confidence | Rate-limit budget remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bullhorn ATS | <N> | <score> | n/a (no quota) |
| LinkedIn (Proxycurl) | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| Reed | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |
| CV-Library | <N> | <score> | <remaining> |

## Diagnostic + exception list
- <Any source failures (e.g., "Reed API 429; retried once; 3 candidates lost")>
- <Any "do not contact" filter hits>
- <Any low-confidence candidates discarded (below 0.5)>
```

Per `decision_log`: one row per source query + one row per candidate proposed + one final aggregate row.

Voice-classified content: only the per-candidate match rationale (Step 9). Voice classifier ≥0.75 against tenant style. Rationale that fails after 3 retries → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT → candidate dropped from list + flagged in exception list.

---

## §4 — Workflow

11 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + multi-source auth + voice corpus
     + DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` (Postgres-
     backed per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split; canonical v0.1 + v0.2 + v0.3
     registered config key)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scout <brief-id-or-slug>")

1. Brief ingestion
   → if brief_id: bullhorn.get_brief(brief_id) → fetch fields
   → if free-text description: LLM parse → extract role / location / sector
     / seniority / day-rate-band / must-haves / nice-to-haves
   → ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY if extraction yields <3 key dimensions (per
     escalation-codes.md §2.5 — canonical code for under-resolvable briefs)
   → hh_decision_output("brief_ingested", "<brief_id_or_slug>",
     "key_dims:<N>")

2. Multi-source auth refresh
   → bullhorn (read-only); LinkedIn/Proxycurl; Reed; CV-Library
   → per-source auth failure fires the catalogue-specified ESC code with
     its catalogue-specified degraded-mode behavior:
     - ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH (catalogue §2.3): blocking → Sourcing Scout
       enters degraded mode (skip Bullhorn source; continue with other 3)
     - ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (Sourcing Scout: cached LinkedIn search only; live profile fetches
       skipped)
     - ESC_REED_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode (cached
       Reed search results only)
     - ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH (catalogue §2.7): blocking → degraded mode
       (cached CV-Library search only)
   → if MULTIPLE sources are in degraded mode AND the remaining live
     sources cannot produce ≥5 candidates: ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE +
     return partial report with exception note (Gate A floor violated)
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "sources_ok:<N>/4; degraded:<list>")

3. Bullhorn passive-match query
   → bullhorn.search_candidates(filter=brief_key_dimensions,
     status='active', date_last_modified_at < now() - interval '90 days')
     — "passive" is a derived state (active candidate not recently
     modified); NOT a vertical-schema enum value. The schema defines
     candidate.status as [active, archived, do_not_contact, placed,
     contractor_promoted] (line 84-88) and candidate.date_last_modified_at
     as the recency field (line 100). Passive-match queries filter on
     modification recency within the active set.
   → up to 30 candidates fetched (will rank+filter later)
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn')
   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

4. LinkedIn search (via Proxycurl)
   → proxycurl.search_people(query=brief_key_dimensions, location=brief_location,
     industry=brief_sector)
   → up to 30 profiles
   → cache 1h per (query, location, sector) tuple
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Proxycurl quota hit (payload.upstream='linkedin')
   → hh_decision_output("linkedin_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

5. Reed query
   → reed.search_candidates(query=brief_dimensions, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_REED_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='reed')
   → hh_decision_output("reed_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

6. CV-Library query
   → cvlibrary.search_candidates(query, location, salary_band)
   → up to 30 candidates
   → ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH on auth fail; ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on quota
     (payload.upstream='cv-library')
   → hh_decision_output("cvlibrary_query", "brief:<id>", "results:<N>")

7. Aggregate + dedupe
   → merge all sources into single candidate set
   → dedupe across sources by (name + email) OR (name + phone) OR
     (LinkedIn URL) — same fuzzy matcher as Janitor (confidence ≥0.85)
   → annotate each row with source provenance (e.g., "from Bullhorn + LinkedIn
     match" if found in both)
   → hh_decision_output("aggregate_dedupe", "brief:<id>",
     "pre_dedupe:<N>; post_dedupe:<N>")

8. "Do not contact" filter (pre-outbound sourcing filter; NOT outbound refusal)
   → load tenant DNC list from `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients`
     (already a registered config key per autosend-policy.yaml red-tier
     `send_to_blocked_recipient`; canonical Postgres-stored structured

    → hh_decision_action("scout_run_complete", brief_id, payload_hash,
      "N=<N> sources_used=<M>")
    → exit code 0

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Sourcing Scout's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 verbatim):

- **"5–15 candidates returned per brief"** (count within range)
- **"each has a working contact method"** (email format + MX check OR E.164 phone OR LinkedIn URL OR Bullhorn bullhorn_id-with-contact)
- **"each has rationale ≥ 50 words"**
- **"no candidate flagged 'do not contact' in tenant config"** (DNC scan against `tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients` Postgres-stored list per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
- All rationales pass voice classifier ≥0.75
- No PII outside firm boundary in rationale text
- No source contributed 0 candidates (suggests source auth failure undetected by Step 2)

Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape violation per catalogue line 184); draft to `/tmp`; operator review.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Sourcing Scout `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W9 build slice. The W9 build delivers `agents/recruitment/sourcing-scout/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 553 verbatim: **"≥6 of 10 candidates advance past first consultant review (shared target with Night Sourcer)"**.

Measured via consultant feedback loop: each candidate in a Sourcing Scout report gets a "useful / not useful" tag from the consultant via Brain UI v1.1 OR Telegram reply OR Bullhorn note. Aggregate over rolling 30-day window per tenant.

Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Gate B is a local leading metric for Sourcing Scout quality; NOT mapped to any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger. Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) — operator review (likely indicates ranking heuristic drift, source-mix imbalance, OR brief-input quality issue).

Shared target with Night Sourcer (v1.1) means: both agents are measured against the same 6-of-10 bar, and the source-abstraction layer (per gotcha of ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555) ensures rank+rationale logic is shared not duplicated.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Sourcing Scout uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | Bullhorn OAuth refresh fails | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.3) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_LINKEDIN_AUTH` | LinkedIn / Proxycurl session/OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_REED_AUTH` | Reed API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_CVLIBRARY_AUTH` | CV-Library API OAuth fail | **blocking** (per catalogue §2.7) | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Any source 429 (payload.upstream identifies which: bullhorn / linkedin / reed / cv-library) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_BRIEF_AMBIGUITY` | LLM brief-parse yields <3 key dimensions (canonical code per catalogue §2.5) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Per-candidate rationale voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in rationale | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Below 6-of-10 for 30 consecutive days | warn | operator_chat_id (per catalogue routing) |

Sourcing Scout does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — no auto-send actions; pure read + report
- `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` — Bullhorn read-only
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Sourcing Scout's Gate A misses are output-shape failures (use `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`)
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Sourcing Scout fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate
- `ESC_DNC_FILTER_HIT` — per catalogue §2.10 reserved for outbound send refusal specifically; Sourcing Scout's DNC filter is a sourcing-time pre-outbound filter. Drops logged in §3 exception list without ESC fire. v0.3 disposition; W4-polish backlog: add ESC_SOURCING_DNC_FILTER.

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 9 (per-candidate rationale generation) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `sourcing_scout`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No demographic inference (age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, family status) — Equality Act 2010 compliance
  - No salary-band reference unless explicitly supplied by candidate
  - No claims about candidate intent ("looking to leave their role") without evidence in source data
  - No mention of competing agency placements except in risk-flag context
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "candidate sourcing rationale" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `sourcing_scout` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns on rationales. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a per-candidate rationale voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Sourcing Scout does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Sourcing Scout.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + 3 commercial signups (Proxycurl + Reed + CV-Library) + Q1 LOI + W9 build slice.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | All three external sources required for v1.0? Reed + CV-Library are UK-recruitment-specific; Proxycurl is LinkedIn-via-API. Could v1.0 ship with Bullhorn + Proxycurl only (2 sources)? | Founder strategic. Recommend 3 sources minimum for 5-15 candidate Gate A coverage; Reed if tenant focused on perm; CV-Library if tenant focused on contract. |
| Q2 | Proxycurl pricing — ~$39/mo for 5,000 credits at low volume; scales with usage. Per pilot tenant budget? | ~5-10 briefs/day per consultant × 50 calls/brief = up to 2,500 credits/day per consultant. Cost: ~$20-50/day at peak. |
| Q3 | DNC list source — tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (Postgres-stored, already-registered config key), with v1.1 derivation from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'? | v1.0: tenant-admin manages via tenant_adapters.config.blocked_recipients (per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres). v1.1: auto-sync from Bullhorn candidate.status='do_not_contact'. |
| Q4 | Rationale length — 50 words feels short for high-quality match explanation. Bump to 100? | Founder review with first pilot consultant feedback. ULTRAPLAN A5 line 552 says "≥ 50 words" — using as floor. |
| Q5 | Gate B 6-of-10 metric — measured via consultant feedback. Brain UI v1.0 doesn't have feedback UX yet. Telegram reply? | v1.0: Telegram reply with "/scout-feedback <candidate-id> useful|not-useful". v1.1: Brain UI button. |
| Q6 | Source-abstraction layer design — Night Sourcer v1.1 reuses this. Should the design be ratified separately (its own ADR)? | Recommend: yes. New ADR-006 at W9 build start documenting source-abstraction interface. |
| Q7 | Bullhorn passive-match query — what's the right SEARCH filter? Per §4 Step 3 + vertical-schema candidate.status enum (`[active, archived, do_not_contact, placed, contractor_promoted]` — line 84-88 of vertical-schema.yaml; "passive" is NOT a canonical enum value), Sourcing Scout queries Bullhorn for `status='active'` candidates with `date_last_modified_at < now() - 90 days` (per schema line 100) to derive "passive" semantically. The question is whether Bullhorn's native search API supports this composite filter efficiently, or whether we need a 2-stage query (status=active first, then client-side modification-recency filter). | Founder + Bullhorn-rep clarification during Sub-decision B response. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555)

1. **LinkedIn rate limits via Proxycurl.** Proxycurl quota is per-credit; deep profile fetches cost more than searches. Plan for cost ceiling per brief.
2. **Reed/CV-Library have separate auth and separate result schemas.** Source-abstraction layer is the load-bearing design (per ULTRAPLAN A5 line 555); Night Sourcer v1.1 will reuse it.
3. **Build the source-abstraction layer carefully.** This is the integration test of "schema before code" (master brief §1 Rule 2) — per-source mapping config, not per-source code branches.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 Q1 (3 sources vs 2) + Q3 (DNC source) + Q5 (Gate B UX)
- Q2 cost model approved with per-tenant budget cap
- Q6: ADR-006 (source-abstraction layer) drafted + ratified

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W9 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production brief processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- Gate B feedback loop operational (Telegram OR Brain UI)
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.
