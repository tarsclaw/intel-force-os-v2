# Scribe — the data spine

**Status:** Proposed (Day-17 pre-W6-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Fathom/Fireflies commercial signup + W6 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W6 per master brief §8.2 line 597 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A3 line 517 (ULTRAPLAN says week 6-7; master brief says week 6; master brief authoritative).
**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 526.
**Tier:** Tier 2 (webhook-driven; not persistent PTY) per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 518.

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Scribe ingests a call transcript from Fathom / Fireflies / Ringover (webhook-triggered within 30 seconds of call end) and produces TWO outputs:** (1) a structured Bullhorn write payload populating ≥3 placement-relevant fields on the appropriate entity (candidate / contractor / contact / brief / opportunity / placement per the call context), and (2) one tacit-note Markdown artefact written to `/vault/<tenant>/scribe-notes/<call_id>-<ISO-date>.md` containing the consultant's "things I'd write down but there's no field for" observations. The tacit-note vault artefact is also mirrored as a Bullhorn `Note` attachment on the resolved entity (consultant-visible in their ATS); the vault copy is the canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split. End-to-end SLA: post-call note in Bullhorn within 10 minutes of webhook receipt per master brief §8.2 line 597. Gate A hard-fails any transcript that doesn't produce ≥3 structured-field extractions AND 1 tacit-note with confidence ≥0.6 (per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 524). Gate B success threshold: 90% of calls processed within 5 minutes; consultant edit-rate on structured fields ≤20% (per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 525). Bullhorn writes are yellow-tier per `autosend-safety-policy.yaml`; tacit-notes are voice-classified (≥0.75 score) per master brief §8.1 Change 1.

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Webhook (v1.0 primary path)

```http
POST https://<tenant>.ifos.app/agents/scribe/webhook
Authorization: Bearer <fathom-or-fireflies-shared-secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "provider": "fathom" | "fireflies" | "ringover",
  "call_id": "<provider-call-id>",
  "transcript_url": "<provider-transcript-url>",
  "duration_seconds": 1234,
  "participants": [...],
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

Each provider has its own webhook signature scheme (Fathom HMAC-SHA256; Fireflies bearer token; Ringover OAuth-protected). Auth handled per-provider in `tools.yaml` capability declarations.

### Manual trigger (v1.0 — debugging / replay)

```bash
ifosctl scribe replay --tenant <slug> --call-id <provider-call-id>
```

Useful when a webhook was missed or a transcript needs reprocessing after taxonomy update.

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Telegram command (`@ifos_bot scribe replay <call-id>`)
- Brain UI per-call "Reprocess" button
- Brain UI "Confidence audit" view showing extraction confidence histograms

---

## §3 — Output shape

Two outputs per webhook. Both write atomically (one transaction); rollback on either failure.

### Output 1 — Bullhorn structured-field writes (≥3 per call)

Bullhorn entity inferred from call participants + tenant Bullhorn lookup:
- 1:1 call with candidate → Candidate entity update
- 1:1 call with client contact → Contact entity update
- Briefing call (consultant + client) → Brief entity update
- Placement check-in (consultant + placed candidate) → Placement entity update
- Opportunity scoping (consultant + prospect) → Opportunity entity update

Minimum 3 fields extracted per call (Gate A). Canonical fields by entity (names per `vertical-schema.yaml` v0.1 + v0.2):

| Entity | Canonical fields (schema-verified) |
|---|---|
| Candidate | `location`, `current_role_title`, `notice_period_weeks`, `salary_expectation_min` + `salary_expectation_max`, `employment_type` (perm/contract/hybrid), `key_skills` (list) |
| Contact | `seniority`, `decision_authority` (enum: yes/no/influencer/blocker/unknown per Q5 v0.1), `preferred_channel`, `next_action_target_date` |
| Brief | `salary_min` + `salary_max`, `start_date`, `role_type`, `must_haves` (list), `nice_to_haves` (list), `deal_breakers` (list) |
| Placement | `start_date`, `placement_status`, `week_1_status_note` (free-text), `satisfaction_signal` (enum) |
| Opportunity | `sector`, `headcount_growth_signal_text`, `hiring_velocity_band`, `decision_window_text` |

Field names match canonical schema verbatim; some v0.1 fields (e.g. `headcount_growth_signal_text`, `satisfaction_signal`, `week_1_status_note`) are scheduled for v0.3 supplement at W6 build start — flagged here as pre-build references requiring schema-supplement landing before Scribe references them in `cycle.sh`. The Q1 verification pass (W6 Day 1) audits all field names against the schema as it exists then.

Each write emits one `decision_log` row: `agent_name='scribe'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='bullhorn_scribe_field_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes confidence per field + transcript timestamp anchors.

### Output 2 — Tacit-note Markdown attachment

One Markdown note per call, attached to the same Bullhorn entity as Output 1 via `POST /Note`. Structure:

```markdown
# Tacit notes — <Call-context-summary>
**Date:** <ISO-date>  **Duration:** <N> min  **Participants:** <list>

## Things observed that don't fit a structured field

- <Observation 1 — bullet, 1-2 sentences, with transcript timestamp [MM:SS]>
- <Observation 2 — ...>
- ...

## Tone signals

- <Tone signal 1 — e.g., "client sounded frustrated about Bullhorn data quality">
- <Tone signal 2 — ...>

## Open questions for consultant follow-up

- <Open question 1>
- <Open question 2>
```

Length cap: 800 words. Voice-classified (≥0.75); falls back to "needs consultant review" placeholder if classifier persistently fails (ESC_VOICE_DRIFT).

Tacit-note taxonomy (v0.1 — 8 categories per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 527 starting small):
1. Relationship signal (client warmth, candidate enthusiasm, prior friction)
2. Process friction (consultant complaint, tool gap, time waste)
3. Competitive intel (mentions of competitor agencies / candidates working with others)
4. Pricing/budget signal (off-record indications of room or constraint)
5. Decision-process insight (who actually decides; coffee-machine politics)
6. Calendar / availability nuance (vacation, life events affecting timeline)
7. Cultural fit observation (working style, communication preferences)
8. Risk flag (legal, IR35, compliance, reference concerns)

v1.1+: expand taxonomy based on first 3 pilot tenants' patterns.

---

## §4 — Workflow

10 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start (webhook handler)
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh + voice
     corpus (for tacit-note voice) + tone rules + recent_edits (drift)
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "scribe webhook for <call_id>")

1. Webhook signature verification
   → per-provider HMAC / bearer / OAuth check
   → ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL on signature mismatch; reject with 401
   → record provider + call_id in trigger payload
   → hh_decision_output("webhook_verified", "call:<id>", "provider:<name>")

2. Bullhorn auth refresh
   → bullhorn.refresh_access_token() per per-agent 8-min refresh loop
   → ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH if refresh fails after 2 retries

3. Transcript fetch
   → provider-specific: fathom.get_transcript(call_id) | fireflies.get(...)
   → ESC_PROVIDER_FETCH_FAIL on 4xx/5xx; retry once 30s backoff
   → store transcript in /tmp/scribe-<tenant>-<call_id>.txt mode 0600
   → ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK if transcript references non-tenant PII

4. Participant + entity inference
   → match transcript participants against Bullhorn contacts + candidates
     + consultant accounts (per tenant config)
   → infer call context (1:1 vs briefing vs placement vs opportunity)
   → resolve target Bullhorn entity (bullhorn_id + entity_type per
     vertical-schema.yaml canonical id field)
   → ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE if no resolvable entity (output shape violation:
     a Scribe run with no resolvable target cannot produce structured writes)
   → hh_decision_output("entity_resolved", "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>", confidence)

5. LLM field extraction
   → prompt = (transcript + entity context + vertical-schema entity field list
     + 3 voice-corpus examples)
   → output = JSON with per-field confidence scores
   → discard fields confidence <0.6 (per Gate A)
   → require ≥3 fields with confidence ≥0.6 OR fire ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE
   → hh_decision_output("fields_extracted", "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>",
     "<N> fields ≥0.6 confidence")

6. LLM tacit-note generation
   → prompt = (transcript + 8-category taxonomy + 3 voice-corpus examples
     + tone-rule filter)
   → output = Markdown narrative per §3 Output 2 shape
   → voice classifier scores against tenant style guide
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score <0.75 after 3 retries
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/scribe-notes/<call_id>-<ISO-date>.md
   → hh_decision_output("tacit_note_rendered", "<vault_path>",
     "voice_score:<N>; words:<N>")

7. Field-extraction validation against vertical-schema
   → verify each extracted field name exists in target entity schema
   → verify each extracted value passes per-field type/range checks
   → drop invalid; require ≥3 valid (per Gate A; failure = ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION
     per catalogue line 163 — vertical-schema field-constraint violation at write time)

8. Bullhorn write — structured fields (yellow tier)
   → PATCH /<EntityType>/<id> with field map
   → atomic transaction; rollback on Bullhorn 4xx/5xx
   → on success: hh_decision_action("bullhorn_scribe_field_write",
     "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → on failure: ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL; do NOT proceed to Step 9

9. Bullhorn write — tacit-note attachment (yellow tier)
   → POST /Note linked to entity from Step 4 (mirror of vault artefact from Step 6)
   → on success: hh_decision_action("bullhorn_note_attach",
     "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>", note_payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → on failure: rollback Step 8 (best-effort PATCH /<EntityType>/<id>
     reversing the field changes); ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL

10. Session close + SLA metric
   → compute elapsed_seconds from webhook receipt
   → if elapsed > 600 (10 min): warn ESC_SCRIBE_SLA_MISS (not blocking)
   → if elapsed > 300 (5 min): info-level (counted against Gate B 90%)
   → hh_decision_action("scribe_run_complete", "call:<id>", elapsed_seconds)
   → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Scribe's `validate.sh` enforces:

- Webhook signature valid per provider (Step 1)
- ≥3 structured-field extractions with confidence ≥0.6 (per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 524 verbatim)
- 1 tacit-note generated with voice classifier ≥0.75
- Field names exist in target entity per vertical-schema.yaml
- Per-field type + range validation passes
- No PII outside firm boundary in tacit-note narrative
- Bullhorn auth refresh succeeded

Gate A failures fire `ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE` (extraction quality) or `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape violation: insufficient fields or no resolvable entity) or `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` (field-constraint violation at vertical-schema write-time per catalogue line 163); transcript stays in `/tmp` (auto-purged 24h); operator notified.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Scribe `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W6 build slice. The W6 build delivers `agents/recruitment/scribe/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome thresholds (success metrics, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A3 line 525 verbatim: **"90% of calls processed within 5 minutes of webhook; consultant edit-rate on structured fields ≤ 20%"**.

Two metrics:
- **SLA:** ≥90% of webhooks-to-Bullhorn-write within 5 min
- **Quality:** consultant edit-rate ≤20% on structured fields (measured via `recent_edit` rows for `agent_name='scribe'`)

Gate B doesn't block individual runs. Tracked monthly via day-30 metrics roll-up (similar to Janitor's day-30 report; Scribe metrics merge into the tenant's monthly executive summary).

Both metrics below target for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → operator + ifos_oncall (likely indicates LLM prompt drift or taxonomy mismatch).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Scribe uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_BULLHORN_WRITE_FAIL` | Bullhorn 4xx/5xx on field write OR note attach | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PROVIDER_FETCH_FAIL` | Fathom/Fireflies/Ringover transcript fetch fails | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Tacit-note voice classifier <0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_FIELD_EXTRACTION_LOW_CONFIDENCE` | <3 fields with confidence ≥0.6 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in transcript or note | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL` | Webhook signature mismatch (Step 1) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | No resolvable target entity (Step 4) — Scribe run cannot produce its declared output shape | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` | Vertical-schema field-constraint violation at write time (Step 7) per catalogue line 163 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_SCRIBE_SLA_MISS` | Webhook-to-Bullhorn-write >10 min (Gate B miss) | info | (logged; aggregated to Gate B metric) |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Bullhorn or provider 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow-tier sample row selected for spot-check | info | operator_chat_id |

Scribe does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's red-tier; Scribe writes are yellow
- `ESC_BULLHORN_OAUTH_REVOKED` — escalated from `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` only after 6 consecutive auth failures (Concierge handles)

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 6 (tacit-note generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `scribe`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No identifying language about call participants beyond their professional context
  - No verbatim quotes longer than 12 words from candidate (paraphrase for privacy)
  - No compensation specifics in tacit notes (those go to structured fields only)
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "internal call summary note" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `scribe` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the tacit-note voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Scribe does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Scribe.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W6 prerequisites)

Scribe build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ |
| Janitor ratified (Bullhorn auth substrate via W5 build) | W5 Codex Round | ⏸ |
| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
| **Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B Accepted** | Bullhorn partnerships response | ⏸ |
| Bullhorn MCP write capability | W3-W4-W5 build chain | ⏸ |
| **Fathom commercial signup** + API access | Founder commercial action | ⏸ |
| Fireflies commercial signup + API access (alternative provider) | Founder commercial action | ⏸ |
| Fathom/Fireflies MCP connector | W6 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant call-routing config (which provider) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
| Tacit-note taxonomy v0.1 (8 categories) finalised | Founder review with first pilot | ⏸ |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W6 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |

| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W6 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |
| LLM extraction + voice-classifier microservice | W4-5 polish | ⏸ |

**Until ALL ⏸ items resolve to ✅, W6 build slice does not start.**

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + Fathom/Fireflies + Q1 LOI + W6 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Fathom vs Fireflies — first-mover provider for v1.0? Both have UK presence; Fathom has tighter Bullhorn ecosystem ties; Fireflies has broader transcript model coverage. | Commercial decision; depends on first pilot tenant's existing tooling. |
| Q2 | Per-call cost ceiling — LLM extraction + voice classification per call. Budget per pilot tenant? | Cost model: ~$0.10-0.30 per call (Claude API + voice classifier). At 50 calls/day per consultant × 5 consultants per tenant = ~$25-75/day per tenant. |
| Q3 | Tacit-note taxonomy v0.1 — 8 categories proposed in §3 above. Founder confidence each is high-value? | Founder review with first pilot tenant's consultants during onboarding; can prune/expand based on actual consultant patterns. |
| Q4 | Webhook signature timeout — provider-specific signature schemes have different replay windows. Should Scribe reject webhooks >5 min old (replay protection)? | Recommend yes; defends against replay attacks. Per-provider timeout config in tools.yaml. |
| Q5 | Bullhorn write atomicity — Step 9 rollback of Step 8 on note-attach failure is best-effort PATCH. Could leave entity in mid-state. | v1.0 accept; document risk. v1.1+: investigate Bullhorn transaction API if exposed. |
| Q6 | Consultant edit-rate ≤20% metric — how to measure when consultants edit Bullhorn entities outside our `recent_edit` audit path? | Use Bullhorn's audit log API + cross-reference with our writes. Founder approve approach at W6 design review. |
| Q7 | What happens when transcript references PII outside tenant's Bullhorn data (e.g., consultant mentions a candidate's spouse's medical condition)? | ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK; transcript NOT written to tacit-note; operator review. Document tenant policy. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A3 line 527)

1. **Tacit-note extraction is the hard part.** Start with small taxonomy (8 categories above); expand based on consultant feedback. Customers will provide examples of "things I'd write down but there's no field for" — that's the training data.
2. **Transcript provider quality varies.** Fathom transcripts tend to be cleaner; Fireflies more comprehensive. Choose per-tenant.
3. **LLM hallucination on field extraction is the failure mode.** Mitigation: confidence threshold ≥0.6 + cross-validation against vertical-schema field-name list + range checks.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 Q1 (Fathom vs Fireflies) + Q3 (taxonomy) + Q4 (webhook timeout)
- Q2 cost model approved with budget cap

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W6 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production transcript processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- SLA + edit-rate Gate-B metrics measurable
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill (when built)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.

*End of Scribe agent.md draft.*
