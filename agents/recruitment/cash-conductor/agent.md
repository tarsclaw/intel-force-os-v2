# Cash Conductor — the FD's evenings back

**Status:** Proposed (Day-18 pre-W7-8-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W7-8 per master brief §8.2 line 598 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A4 line 531 (both say W7-8; consistent).
**Build complexity:** L (2 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 540.
**Tier:** Tier 1 (persistent watcher on accounting + bank webhooks + cron sweep) per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 532.
**Hire #1 anchor:** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "Cash Conductor at week 7-8 because Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7". First sprint for Hire #1.

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Cash Conductor produces THREE outputs continuously:** (1) real-time invoice ↔ bank-deposit reconciliation rows written to the tenant's accounting system (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage per tenant config), (2) yellow-tier payment-chase email drafts (sampled spot-check) queued to Concierge for send; Concierge handles the orange-tier customer-facing send (`xero_reminder_send_customer`) after operator approval — Cash Conductor only drafts, never sends customer-facing, and (3) a weekly cash-flow Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md` (generated Monday 06:00 UTC). NO direct Bullhorn API dependency — Cash Conductor operates against the tenant's accounting + Open Banking stack (no Bullhorn endpoint calls). It DOES read cached Bullhorn placement + client_contact rows from Postgres for addressee-resolution integrity (per ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH catalogue §2.10 — Cash Conductor verifies invoice addressee matches Bullhorn placement client OR Xero contact). The cached Bullhorn rows are populated by Janitor + Scribe + Concierge from their direct Bullhorn endpoint paths; Cash Conductor never calls Bullhorn directly. Per ADR-005 strategic-value rationale: Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn API slips because it only reads the cache. Gate A hard-fails any chase draft that doesn't reference the correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538). Gate A also blocks any chase for an invoice paid in last 24 hours (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim). Gate B success threshold: tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539) — the FD-tier closer metric. Chase drafts are yellow-tier `xero_reminder_draft_internal` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 182-187 — internal draft sampled for spot-check); the customer-facing send routed via Concierge is orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` (per `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` lines 257-262; consultant approval required before send). Reconciliation writes are yellow-tier (`accounting_reconciliation_write` per autosend-policy.yaml; registered as part of 2026-05-24 bilateral catalogue extension).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Webhook (v1.0 primary path)

```http
POST https://<tenant>.ifos.app/agents/cash-conductor/webhook
Authorization: Bearer <provider-shared-secret>
Content-Type: application/json

# Event types (per provider):
# - Xero/QuickBooks/Sage: invoice.created, invoice.sent, invoice.viewed,
#   invoice.paid, payment.received
# - Open Banking (TrueLayer/Plaid UK): transaction.posted, balance.updated
```

Per-provider webhook auth handled in `tools.yaml`.

### Cron (daily reconciliation sweep)

```bash
# 07:00 UTC daily — bank feed catch-up + invoice age scan
0 7 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-cash-conductor.sh --tenant <slug> --mode daily-sweep
```

### Weekly report cron

```bash
# Monday 06:00 UTC — cash-flow report regeneration
0 6 * * 1 sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-cash-conductor.sh --tenant <slug> --mode weekly-report
```

### Per-trigger auth requirements

- **Webhook (v1.0 primary path):** per-provider HMAC / bearer token verified at the ingress per `tools.yaml` capability declarations (matching the Scribe webhook auth pattern).
- **Cron (daily-sweep + weekly-report):** runs under `ifos_user` OS account (per Day-4 §6.5 tenant-provision script) via systemd-timer-style invocation; no inbound auth (process started by cron daemon with the right OS user identity). RLS isolation via `app.current_tenant` SET LOCAL per Day-4 §7.
- **Manual triggers (ifosctl below):** require operator OS account in the `ifos-operators` group; per-invocation `--tenant <slug>` is verified against the operator's tenant access list in `tenant_adapters` before execution. Founder + Hire #1 are the v1.0 ifosctl-authorized operators per master brief §8.2 line 604.
- **v1.1+ Brain UI:** session-cookie auth + per-tenant operator role check (deferred).

### Manual triggers (v1.0)

```bash
ifosctl cash-conductor reconcile --tenant <slug> [--invoice <id>]
ifosctl cash-conductor draft-chase --tenant <slug> --invoice <id>
ifosctl cash-conductor weekly-report --tenant <slug>
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI cash-flow dashboard
- Per-tenant Telegram daily summary
- FD-mode end-of-month report (more detailed than weekly)

## §3 — Output shape

Three outputs. All load-bearing.

### Output 1 — Reconciliation rows (yellow tier)

Per webhook event, Cash Conductor reconciles incoming bank deposits against the tenant's open invoice register. Match algorithm:

| Stage | Match dimensions | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Exact amount + matching invoice reference in transaction memo | 0.98 |
| 2 | Exact amount + matching payee name | 0.85 |
| 3 | Exact amount + within-90-day-of-invoice-issue window | 0.70 |
| 4 | Fuzzy amount (±0.5% rounding) + matching payee name | 0.65 |
| 5 | Unmatched (queued for review) | <0.50 |

Stages 1-2 auto-write reconciliation to accounting system (yellow tier; spot-check sampled). Stages 3-4 queue for consultant review. Stage 5 flagged in weekly report.

Each reconciliation write: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='action'`, `action_type='accounting_reconciliation_write'`, `tier='yellow'`, payload includes match confidence + match dimensions.

### Output 2 — Payment-chase drafts (yellow tier internal; Cash Conductor INITIATES the orange-tier customer send via Concierge approval bridge)

For invoices >7 days overdue with no reconciliation match, Cash Conductor drafts a chase email. The draft itself is a yellow-tier internal output (`xero_reminder_draft_internal`); when Cash Conductor decides to send, it WRITES the orange-tier `hh_decision_action("xero_reminder_send_customer", ...)` row (Cash Conductor owns this action_type per autosend-policy.yaml line 257) which OPENS the orange approval flow — Concierge then handles the autosend-bridge routing + actual transport (Microsoft Graph / Gmail). Cash Conductor owns the action_type; Concierge handles the approval + transport mechanics.

Chase draft structure:

```yaml
draft_id: <uuid>
invoice_id: <accounting-system-invoice-id>
contact_email: <client-billing-contact-email>
subject: "Friendly reminder — invoice <number> from <YYYY-MM-DD>"
body_markdown: <voice-classified consultant-tone reminder>
amount_due: <decimal>
days_overdue: <int>
prior_chases_sent: <int>
escalation_ladder_position: 1-4 per §3.2 below
expected_send_window: orange-tier approval expected within 24h
```

Each draft: `decision_log` row `agent_name='cash_conductor'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_draft_internal'` (yellow tier per autosend-policy.yaml lines 182-187). When Cash Conductor decides to actually send (after draft validation passes Gate A), it also writes a second row `phase='action'`, `action_type='xero_reminder_send_customer'` (orange tier per autosend-policy.yaml line 257; Cash Conductor owns this action_type) — this row OPENS the orange-tier approval bridge. Concierge then handles the approval + transport. After Concierge confirms send, Cash Conductor receives the webhook + writes a green-tier `phase='output'` status marker recording the completion.

### §3.2 — Chase escalation ladder

| Position | Trigger | Tone | Voice classifier minimum |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 7 days overdue | "Friendly reminder, hope everything's OK on your end" | ≥0.75 |
| 2 | 14 days overdue, position-1 sent | "Following up — please let us know if there's a query" | ≥0.75 |
| 3 | 21 days overdue, position-2 sent | "Need to flag this; can we schedule a quick call?" | ≥0.80 (higher bar) |
| 4 | 30 days overdue, position-3 sent | "Escalation to operator review" — drafts STOP; operator manual handle | n/a (not sent) |

Position 4 is the kill-switch: Cash Conductor never auto-drafts beyond position 3. Operator decides next step manually.

### Output 3 — Weekly cash-flow Markdown report

Located at `/vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md`. Generated Monday 06:00 UTC. Six sections:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Week summary** | Receipts received + invoices issued + invoices paid + new chases sent |
| 2 | **DSO trend** | Days-Sales-Outstanding metric this week vs prior-week vs month-0 baseline; Gate B tracking |
| 3 | **Aged debtors** | Invoices outstanding bucketed (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days); per-client totals |
| 4 | **Chase pipeline** | Active chase drafts by position 1-3; pending consultant approval; sent-but-no-response |
| 5 | **Cash-flow forecast** | 4-week forward cash projection (open invoices + expected payments per historical conversion rate) |
| 6 | **Exception list** | Reconciliation failures; bank-feed gaps; accounting-API failures; operator action items |

## §4 — Workflow

14 steps. Per ADR-003 §3 agent-bundle pattern + the review-agent-bundle Codex ratification skill §4 ("every output/action step MUST call hh_decision_*"): every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`. Master brief §8.1 Change 2 mandates the three-call minimum per agent run (`trigger`, `output`, `action`); the per-step mandatory-write discipline is the agent-bundle contract extension.

```
0. Session start (webhook OR cron OR manual)
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + accounting-provider auth +
     Open Banking auth + voice corpus + tone rules
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "<webhook|cron|manual>")

1. Provider auth refresh
   → accounting: Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh per provider
   → Open Banking: TrueLayer/Plaid UK 90-day token refresh (CRITICAL —
     gotcha per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541); staged ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING:
     ≤30d info, ≤14d warn, ≤7d blocking (operator must re-authorise)
   → ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH or ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH on auth failure
   → hh_decision_output("auth_refresh_complete", "tenant:<slug>",
     "accounting:<ok|fail>; open_banking:<ok|fail>; token_aging_stage:<info|warn|blocking|fresh>")

2. Event router (mode-dependent)
   → if mode=webhook: parse event_type → routes to Step 3-7 path
   → if mode=daily-sweep: routes to Step 4 (invoice ingest) → Step 5 (reconciliation) → Step 7 (chase generation pass) catch-up sequence; sweeps run the full reconciliation-first-then-chase pipeline
   → if mode=weekly-report: skip to Step 13

3. Bank transaction ingest (mode=webhook from Open Banking)
   → fetch latest transactions since last_ingested_at
   → normalise schema (TrueLayer vs Plaid have different formats)
   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_transactions` (RLS-isolated per
     tenant per Day-4 §6.3 + tenancy-invariants T1-T3; W7 build slice creates
     the table per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split — structured state in Postgres,
     not vault markdown)
   → hh_decision_output("transactions_ingested", "tenant:<slug>",
     "<N> rows since <last_ingested_at>")

4. Invoice register ingest (mode=webhook from accounting OR daily-sweep)
   → accounting.list_open_invoices() per provider
   → store in Postgres table `cash_conductor_invoices` (RLS-isolated;
     W7 build slice creates per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split)
   → hh_decision_output("invoices_ingested", "tenant:<slug>", "<N> rows")

5. Reconciliation pass (5-stage match algorithm per §3 Output 1)
   → for each transaction × open invoice: compute match confidence
   → write Stage 1-2 matches to accounting (yellow tier) atomically
   → queue Stage 3-4 matches for consultant review (ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS
     per stage)
   → flag Stage 5 (unmatched) in weekly-report exception list
   → hh_decision_output("reconciliation_pass", "tenant:<slug>",
     "stage1_2:<N>; stage3_4:<N>; stage5:<N>")

6. Reconciliation write (yellow tier; per match)
   → accounting.write_payment_received(invoice_id, payment_id, amount, date)
   → atomic transaction; rollback on 4xx/5xx
   → on success: hh_decision_action("accounting_reconciliation_write",
     "invoice:<id>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
   → on failure: ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL
   → spot-check sampling per autosend-safety-policy.yaml yellow tier

7. Chase generation pass (for overdue, unmatched invoices)
   → query open invoices with age >7 days AND no Stage-1/2 reconciliation
   → for each, determine chase position 1-4 based on age + prior chases
     sent (read from `cash_conductor_invoices.last_chase_position` — v0.3
     schema-backed field per migration §3; NOT from decision_log payload)
   → if position=4: STOP — operator review (no auto-draft).
     hh_decision_output("chase_position_4_operator_review",
     "invoice:<id>", "age_days:<N>; prior_chases:3") — records the
     operator-review outcome explicitly per §4 mandatory-write discipline
   → else: proceed to Step 8

8. LLM chase-draft generation (per overdue invoice)
   → prompt = (invoice details + client context + position-N tone +
     voice corpus + tone rules)
   → output = email body + subject
   → voice classifier scores against tenant style (≥0.75 for position 1-2;
     ≥0.80 for position 3 per §3.2)
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <threshold after 3 retries
   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_generated", "invoice:<id>",
     "position:<N>; voice_score:<N>; words:<N>")

9. Chase-draft validation (Gate A specifics)
   → verify: invoice_number cited matches invoice_id
   → verify: amount_due cited matches accounting record
   → verify: client_contact_email matches active billing contact
   → verify: NOT paid in last 24h (re-query accounting)
   → ESC code mapping by failure class:
     - invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition mismatch →
       `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint failure)
     - client_contact_email / addressee mismatch (chase routed to wrong
       customer) → `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (per catalogue §2.10 — explicitly
       blocking for Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee resolution)
     `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` is reserved for red-tier action attempts per
     catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's chase pipeline is orange-tier.
   → hh_decision_output("chase_draft_validated", invoice_id, "passed")

10. Chase-draft queue to Concierge (opens orange-tier approval bridge)
    → POST internal API → Concierge agent receives draft
    → hh_decision_action("xero_reminder_draft_internal", "invoice:<id>",
      payload_hash, payload_preview) — tier=yellow internal-draft per
      autosend-policy.yaml line 182
    → hh_decision_action("xero_reminder_send_customer", "invoice:<id>",
      payload_hash, payload_preview) — tier=orange per autosend-policy.yaml
      line 257; Cash Conductor owns this action_type and OPENS the
      orange-approval-bridge; Concierge handles autosend-bridge call to
      operator (D1 path per Founder Decision)

11. (Operator approves via Concierge → Concierge sends + writes its own
    orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` action row → Cash Conductor
    records the webhook + state update)
    → Concierge fires webhook back: chase_sent
    → Cash Conductor updates `cash_conductor_invoices.last_chase_position`
      and `last_chase_sent_at` (v0.3 schema-backed fields per migration §3)
    → hh_decision_output("cash_conductor_chase_sent_recorded",
      "invoice:<id>", "position:<N>; sent_at:<ISO>") — phase=output;
      green-tier internal status marker recording that Concierge sent the
      chase + state mutation completed. The orange-tier
      `xero_reminder_send_customer` action row is Concierge's
      responsibility, NOT Cash Conductor's.

12. (Mode=webhook only) Re-trigger eligibility check
    → was this webhook also a "payment received" that just hit?
    → re-run Step 5 to check if any chases-in-flight should be cancelled
      (paid-since-draft-but-before-send race condition)
    → if so: ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE → cancel chase draft (do NOT send)
    → hh_decision_output("chase_cancellation_check", "invoice:<id>",
      "cancelled:<bool>")

13. Weekly report assembly (mode=weekly-report; runs Monday 06:00 UTC)
    → query decision_log + accounting + bank feed for the 7-day window
    → compute DSO metric (Gate B tracking)
    → 6-section Markdown report per §3 Output 3
    → write to /vault/<tenant>/cash-conductor-reports/weekly-<ISO-date>.md
    → hh_decision_output("weekly_report", report_path,
      "dso_delta_days:<N>; sections:6")

14. Session close
    → update tenant_adapters.config.cash_conductor_last_run = now()
    → hh_decision_action("cash_conductor_run_complete", "session:<session_id>",
      payload_hash, "run_mode:<mode>; matches:<N>; chases:<N>; report:<bool>")
      — hh_decision_action signature is (action_type, target, payload_hash,
      payload_preview) per agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh contract
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Cash Conductor's `validate.sh` enforces (per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 538 verbatim):

- **"chase email references correct invoice number AND correct amount AND correct contact"** (all three; AND not OR)
- **"never proposes chase for an invoice that's been paid in last 24h"** (defence-in-depth re-query at draft time)
- Voice classifier score ≥0.75 for position 1-2 chases; ≥0.80 for position 3
- No PII outside firm boundary in chase body
- Reconciliation match confidence ≥0.85 for auto-write (Stage 1-2 only)
- Open Banking token ≥7 days from expiry (≤7d is blocking per ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING staged definition; ≤30d info + ≤14d warn are health-warning states that do NOT block Gate A, only signal upcoming reauth need)
- Accounting auth refresh succeeded in Step 1

Gate A failures fire either `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (invoice/amount/paid-precondition miss; output-shape constraint) OR `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` (client_contact_email mismatch; blocking per catalogue §2.10 — explicit Cash Conductor invoice/chase addressee case). Draft stays in `/tmp` (auto-purged 24h); operator notified per the specific ESC route.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Cash Conductor `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W7 build slice. The W7 build delivers `agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (FD-tier closer metric)

Per ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 verbatim: **"tenant DSO at month-3 ≥ 12 days lower than month-0 baseline"**.

DSO = Days Sales Outstanding = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days.

Measured monthly via the weekly report's §2 trend. Month-0 baseline established at first pilot LOI signing (before Cash Conductor active). Month-3 target = month-0 minus 12 days.

This is THE FD-tier closer metric per master brief §8.2 line 598 ("DSO drops by 15 days"; ULTRAPLAN A4 line 539 sets the 12-day Gate B target — note minor drift from the master brief's 15-day pitch which is the more aggressive marketing position) — a local leading metric for Cash Conductor quality. Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3: Cash Conductor's DSO improvement is NOT directly mapped to a v1.0 kill-criterion trigger; it's tracked as a local Gate B signal. Below ≥12 days improvement for 2 consecutive months → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → founder + operator review (likely indicates heuristic tuning, escalation-ladder timing, OR tenant-specific late-payment patterns we haven't modelled).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Cash Conductor uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_AUTH` | Xero/QuickBooks/Sage OAuth refresh fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_ACCOUNTING_WRITE_FAIL` | Accounting 4xx/5xx on reconciliation write | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_AUTH` | TrueLayer/Plaid UK auth fails after 2 retries | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING` | Open Banking PSD2 consent approaching 90-day expiry (staged) | info ≤30d / warn ≤14d / **blocking** ≤7d (per catalogue §2.7) | operator_chat_id (info+warn); + ifos_oncall_chat_id at blocking stage |
| `ESC_RECONCILIATION_AMBIGUOUS` | Stage 3-4 match queued for review | warn (per catalogue §2.10) | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_RACE` | Payment received between chase-draft and chase-send window | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Chase voice classifier below threshold after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary in chase body | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A miss on invoice_number / amount_due / paid-invoice-precondition (NOT addressee mismatch — that uses ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` | Gate A miss on client_contact_email / addressee resolution (per catalogue §2.10 Cash Conductor case) | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | DSO improvement below 12-day target for 2 consecutive months | warn | founder + operator |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Accounting OR Open Banking 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING` | Chase draft awaiting consultant approval — heartbeat at ≥50% of declared timeout (per catalogue §2.9 trigger) | info | operator_chat_id (gentle reminder; no oncall CC) |

Cash Conductor does NOT use:

- Bullhorn-specific codes (no Bullhorn dependency)
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — that's red-tier per catalogue line 41; Cash Conductor's pipeline is orange-tier (chase send) or yellow-tier (reconciliation write); Gate A misses fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Cash Conductor's Gate A misses are output-shape failures, not schema-field violations
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` — fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Cash Conductor fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`, never the aggregate

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Step 8 (chase-draft generation) is the only voice-classified output. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `cash_conductor`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "Final demand" or legal-threatening language (escalation ladder caps at position 3; position 4 is operator-handled)
  - No reference to the client's industry / sector pain points (chase is operational, not strategic)
  - No mentions of late-payment fees unless tenant's terms explicitly state them
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching "professional polite chase email" task context.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `cash_conductor` agent**: detects consultant edit patterns. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the chase voice classifier score is below threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Cash Conductor does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Cash Conductor.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

---

## §8 — Build dependencies (W7-8 prerequisites)

Cash Conductor build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 ratified | ✅ |
| Diagnostic ratified (first-agent precedent) | Week 3 Codex Round 4 Phase 1 | ⏸ |
| First pilot tenant onboarded | Post Q1-LOI | ⏸ |
| **Tenant's accounting choice confirmed** (Xero / QuickBooks / Sage) | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| **Accounting commercial signup** (developer access + sandbox) | Founder commercial | ⏸ |
| **Open Banking commercial signup** (TrueLayer or Plaid UK) | Founder commercial; ~£100-300/mo | ⏸ |
| Xero MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| QuickBooks MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days) | ⏸ |
| Sage MCP connector | W7 build start (~2 days; may defer if no pilot uses Sage v1.0) | ⏸ |
| Open Banking MCP connector | W7 build start (~3 days; harder due to 90-day token rotation) | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant accounting credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Per-tenant Open Banking credentials in `_secrets.env` | Tenant onboarding | ⏸ |
| Concierge agent.md ratified Accepted (for chase-send routing contract; full Concierge production-build at W10-13, but Cash Conductor only depends on the Concierge agent.md contract being Accepted, not the full bundle being In Force) | Post-Concierge agent.md re-ratification | ⏸ |
| Voice corpus seeded for first pilot tenant | Tenant-admin onboarding | ⏸ |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic | Build at W7 start (~1 day; complex due to 4 validators) | ⏸ |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W7 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ |
| `cycle.sh` orchestration (14-step) | Build at W7 start (~3 days; most complex of v1.0 agents) | ⏸ |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs | Build at W7 start (~1 day) | ⏸ |

**ADR-005 framing:** ADR-005 (Week-3 Diagnostic acceleration) notes Cash Conductor is unaffected by Bullhorn slips because it has zero Bullhorn dependency. v0.3 supplement: Cash Conductor pull-forward (from W7-8 to W4-5) is NOT explicitly authorised by ADR-005 §5.1 (that section number doesn't exist; earlier draft mis-cited). Pull-forward would require a separate ADR (e.g. ADR-007 if/when needed); accounting + Open Banking commercial signups remain founder-action gates regardless of timing.

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + accounting + Open Banking commercial signups + W7-8 build slice start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | First-tenant accounting choice — Xero / QuickBooks / Sage? Affects which connector is W7-prio-1. | Tenant onboarding; depends on first pilot tenant's existing stack. |
| Q2 | Open Banking provider — TrueLayer or Plaid UK? Both have UK coverage; TrueLayer slightly cheaper at low volume; Plaid has broader US-EU coverage for v1.1+ expansion. | Founder commercial. Recommend TrueLayer for v1.0 UK-only pilots. |
| Q3 | Open Banking 90-day token rotation UX — when token nears expiry, operator must re-authenticate via tenant's bank login. How is this triggered? Telegram nudge? Brain UI dashboard? | Recommend: ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING fires Telegram nudge at 30/14/7 days; tenant-admin handles via Brain UI v1.1. |
| Q4 | Chase escalation ladder — 4 positions proposed in §3.2. Founder confidence each position's timing + tone is right? | Founder review with first pilot tenant; varies by tenant's payment terms (net-30 vs net-14 vs net-60). |
| Q5 | Reconciliation Stage 3-4 (fuzzy / ambiguous matches) — consultant review queue UX. Brain UI workflow? Telegram? | v1.0: weekly report exception list. v1.1: Brain UI per-row review queue. |
| Q6 | DSO baseline establishment — month-0 baseline measured pre-deployment. How do we measure if accounting system data is incomplete or fragmented? | First pilot tenant: 30-day baseline measurement period BEFORE Cash Conductor goes live; documented in pilot LOI. |
| Q7 | Hire #1 anchor — what specific Cash Conductor sub-tasks does Hire #1 take vs Claude Code? | Founder strategic decision; recommend Hire #1 owns Open Banking connector + ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING UX. Cash Conductor agent.md + cycle.sh stays with founder + Claude Code for consistency with other agents. |
| Q8 | Sage connector — defer if no v1.0 pilot uses Sage? Saves ~2 days. Risk: blocks future Sage-using pilots. | Recommend defer to v1.1; document in W7 build start review. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A4 line 541)

1. **Open Banking auth is a 90-day token; rotation logic is non-trivial.** Plan for the rotation UX up-front; ESC_OPEN_BANKING_TOKEN_AGING staged at 30/14/7 days from expiry; document tenant-admin re-auth procedure.
2. **Bank feed reconciliation against invoice register is the hard logic.** Start with exact-amount matches (Stage 1-2); expand to fuzzy (Stage 3-4) as confidence builds.
3. **5 stages of match algorithm** is intentionally conservative for v1.0 to avoid false-positive reconciliation writes (which corrupt the tenant's accounting books).
4. **Hire #1 is assumed to start week 7** per master brief §8.2 line 604 — "verify, don't assume." If Hire #1 doesn't start on time, Cash Conductor build runs founder-solo and may slip.

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- Founder approves §9 Q1 + Q2 + Q4 + Q7 + Q8
- Q3 UX flow approved (operator re-auth path)

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W7-8 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 3 fixtures
- First production webhook processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- 30-day month-0 baseline measured for first pilot
- Hire #1 onboarded + integrated into the build workstream (per master brief §8.2 line 604)
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold.
