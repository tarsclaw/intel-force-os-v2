# Concierge — no candidate ghosted

**Status:** Proposed (Day-19 pre-W10-build scaffold; awaits Q1 LOI + Bullhorn Sub-decisions A+B + Microsoft Graph / Gmail per-tenant signup + Founder Decision D1 autosend orange-tier path + W10 build slice).
**Date:** 2026-05-24.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W10-13 per master brief §8.2 line 600 + ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A6 line 559 (master brief says W10-13 = 4 weeks; ULTRAPLAN says W9-10 = 2 weeks; master brief authoritative — the XL complexity flag in ULTRAPLAN A6 line 568 corroborates the 4-week duration).
**Build complexity:** XL (4 weeks) per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 568 — "the biggest v1.0 agent because of the lifecycle state machine and the breadth of comms types (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6)".
**Tier:** Tier 1 (persistent state across candidate lifecycle) per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 560. Uses cortextOS primitives #1 (Persistent PTY), #2 (context rotation), #4 (approval gates), #5 (Telegram surface).

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Concierge is the customer-comms agent — it makes sure no candidate is ghosted.** It monitors lifecycle events across the candidate journey in Bullhorn (interview-booked → interview-completed → offer-extended → offer-accepted → placement-confirmed → start-date-confirmed → 7-day-check-in → 30-day-check-in → 90-day-check-in, plus rejection / withdrawal / on-hold branches) and produces customer-facing email drafts (acknowledgement, prep, debrief, rejection, placement, check-ins ×6) at each event. Each draft is written to vault at `/vault/<tenant>/concierge-drafts/<draft_id>.md` (canonical narrative source per ADR-002 vault/Postgres split); approval routes through the autosend-bridge (Founder Decision D1 path) and on approval the send executes via tenant's Microsoft Graph OR Gmail (per-tenant config; agent-identity email adapter (deferred) deferred to v1.1+). Drafts are yellow-tier `concierge_email_draft` (registered in `agents/_shared/autosend-policy.yaml` under §YELLOW; internal, voice-classified, sample-spot-checked); the customer-facing send is orange-tier — `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` (§ORANGE) or `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` (§ORANGE canonical) depending on channel. Gate A hard-fails any draft with voice classifier below the position-specific threshold (≥0.75 standard / ≥0.82 sensitive) OR any draft with incorrect addressee resolution (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 — "no candidates emailed under another's name"). The 30-minute SLA from lifecycle event to draft is per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 a Gate A hard-fail (verbatim "every lifecycle event has a draft generated within 30 minutes"). v0.3 Concierge agent.md disposition (per bilateral founder authorization): the per-draft 30-min check is interpreted as a Gate B leading metric (90% target) rather than per-draft hard-fail to avoid blocking legitimate polling-fallback delays. **This is a documented deviation from ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim wording** — to be ratified separately via a future Concierge-Gate-A ADR (analogous to ADR-006 for Diagnostic) before Concierge Status flips Proposed → Accepted. Until that ADR ratifies, agent.md's Gate B framing of the 30-min SLA is a documented disposition, not an upstream-spec match. Gate B success thresholds: <5% candidate-ghosted rate + ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts + ≥90% 30-min SLA hit (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567). This is the highest-stakes v1.0 agent — every send is customer-facing; voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case (per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha). XL build complexity (4 weeks) reflects the state-machine surface area + comms-type breadth + cortextOS primitive integration depth.

## §2 — Invocation surface

### Lifecycle webhook (v1.0 primary)

```http
# Bullhorn placement state-change webhook → Concierge handler
POST https://<tenant>.ifos.app/agents/concierge/webhook
Authorization: Bearer <bullhorn-shared-secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event_type": "placement.state_changed" | "candidate.state_changed",
  "entity_id": "<bullhorn-id>",
  "from_state": "interview_scheduled",
  "to_state": "interview_completed",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>"
}
```

Bullhorn webhook coverage is patchy per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 gotcha — see Step 1 polling fallback.

### Cron (polling fallback + time-elapsed nurture)

```bash
# Every 5 min: poll Bullhorn for missed state transitions
*/5 * * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-concierge.sh --tenant <slug> --mode poll
# Daily 09:00 UTC: time-elapsed nurture sweeps (7d / 30d / 90d check-ins)
0 9 * * * sudo -u ifos_user /usr/local/bin/ifos-concierge.sh --tenant <slug> --mode nurture-sweep
```

### Manual (debugging)

```bash
ifosctl concierge generate --tenant <slug> --candidate <id> --event <event-type>
ifosctl concierge replay --tenant <slug> --webhook-id <id>
```

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- agent-identity email adapter (deferred) integration (agent-identity sends for non-rejection comms)
- Brain UI lifecycle-event timeline viewer per candidate
- Per-tenant comms-type taxonomy customisation

## §3 — Output shape

One output per lifecycle event: an email draft (orange tier). 12 lifecycle events × per-tenant comms-template variants:

| # | Event | Comms type | Recipient | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Application received | Acknowledgement | Candidate | Warm, professional, sets expectations on response timeline |
| 2 | Interview booked | Prep | Candidate | Practical (date, time, format, interviewers) + role context |
| 3 | Interview completed | Debrief | Candidate | Thank-you + next-step clarity OR "we'll be in touch by X" |
| 4 | Offer extended | Placement-positive | Candidate | Excited, clear on terms, addressee-resolution-critical |
| 5 | Offer accepted | Placement-confirm | Candidate + Client (separate drafts) | Reassurance + practical next steps |
| 6 | Rejected (post-interview) | Rejection | Candidate | THE HARDEST CASE per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 — respectful, specific, leaves door open |
| 7 | Withdrawn (candidate-initiated) | Acknowledgement | Candidate | Respectful, no pressure, leaves door open |
| 8 | On-hold | Status-update | Candidate | Honest about timeline, sets expectations on next update |
| 9 | Start date confirmed | Placement-pre-start | Candidate + Client | Practical (HR forms, IT setup, day-1 logistics) |
| 10 | 7-day check-in (post-start) | Nurture-check-in | Candidate | "How's it going? Any blockers?" — short, low-pressure |
| 11 | 30-day check-in | Nurture-check-in | Candidate + Client | Slightly longer; both sides; reads for placement-risk signals |
| 12 | 90-day check-in | Nurture-check-in + relationship | Candidate + Client | Establishes ongoing relationship; offers "is there anyone in your network looking?" |

Draft structure per event:

```yaml
draft_id: <uuid>
event_type: <one of 12 above>
candidate_id: <bullhorn-id>
placement_id: <bullhorn-id or null>
recipient: <candidate-email | client-contact-email>
recipient_role: candidate | client_contact
subject: <subject line; voice-classified>
body_markdown: <body; voice-classified>
voice_score: <0-1>
addressee_resolution_check: passed | failed
attached_documents: <list — e.g., feedback summary, prep guide, comms history>
escalation_position: 1-3 (for sensitive sends like rejection)
expected_send_window: <ISO; respects sending-hours per tenant config>
```

Each draft: `decision_log` row with `agent_name='concierge'`, `phase='output'`, `action_type='concierge_email_draft'` (registered yellow tier per autosend-policy.yaml), `tier='yellow'`, payload includes `event_type` + `voice_score` + `recipient` + `escalation_position` (event-type is a payload field, not part of action_type — keeps action_type stable across 12 lifecycle events).

The actual SEND is a separate orange-tier action_type:
- `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` (orange tier per autosend-policy.yaml §ORANGE) when channel=email
- `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` (orange tier; canonical orange per autosend-policy.yaml §ORANGE) when channel=Bullhorn note with isExternal=true
- `twilio_sms_send` (orange tier per autosend-policy.yaml §ORANGE) when channel=SMS (v1.1+)
- `calendar_invite_send` (orange tier per autosend-policy.yaml §ORANGE) when event includes calendar attachment

Consultant approves via autosend-bridge (D1 path) → orange-tier send executes → Bullhorn activity-log entry written post-send.

---

## §4 — Workflow

15 steps. Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start (webhook OR poll OR cron)
   → context.sh hydrates: tenant config + Bullhorn auth refresh +
     Microsoft Graph / Gmail auth + agent-identity email adapter (deferred) (if v1.1+ enabled) +
     voice corpus + tone rules + recent_edits + tenant comms-template
     library + addressee-resolution data
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", "<webhook|poll|cron-nurture>")

1. Source detection (mode-dependent)
   → mode=webhook: parse Bullhorn payload → resolve entity + state transition
   → mode=poll: query Bullhorn for placements/candidates with state_changed_at
     > tenant_adapters.config.concierge_last_poll AND not in decision_log
     (anti-duplicate)
   → mode=nurture-sweep: query Bullhorn placements for time-elapsed events
     (7d/30d/90d post-start with no concierge action in last 14d)
   → ESC_LIFECYCLE_STATE_UNKNOWN if state transition not in 12-event taxonomy
   → hh_decision_output("lifecycle_event_detected",
     "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>", "<from>→<to>")

2. Anti-duplicate guard
   → query decision_log for prior `concierge_email_draft` row for same
     (candidate_id, payload.event_type) in last 24h with phase IN
     ('output', 'action') — if a prior draft was emitted AND either sent OR
     is still pending consultant action, the new event is a duplicate trigger
   → if found AND send-completed: skip (true duplicate)
   → if found BUT prior draft never sent (no `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate`
     follow-up action row): allow the new draft attempt (per Q7 disposition)
   → hh_decision_output("anti_duplicate_check", "<entity_type>:<bullhorn_id>",
     "<duplicate_status>")

3. Bullhorn context fetch
   → bullhorn.get_candidate(candidate_id) → name, current state, comms history
   → bullhorn.get_placement(placement_id) → role, client, dates
   → bullhorn.get_client(client_id) → company name, primary contact
   → bullhorn.get_contact(contact_id) → name, email
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT on Bullhorn 429 (payload.upstream='bullhorn');
     ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH on auth fail
   → ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE if critical Bullhorn context fields missing
     (no email, no name) — Concierge cannot produce its declared output
     shape (lifecycle-event draft) without a resolvable target candidate.
     NOTE: ESC_CANDIDATE_DATA_INCOMPLETE is reserved for Sourcing Scout
     shortlist completeness per catalogue §2.10.
   → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_context_fetched",
     "candidate:<bullhorn_id>", "fields_present:<N>")

4. Addressee resolution (Gate A critical)
   → recipient = candidate.email OR client_contact.email per event_type
   → verify recipient matches the candidate_id whose lifecycle is changing
     (NOT another candidate's email — per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim
     "correct addressee resolution; no candidates emailed under another's name")
   → ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH if check fails (blocking); draft aborted
   → hh_decision_output("addressee_resolved", "candidate:<bullhorn_id>",
     "recipient_role:<role>")

5. Comms-template selection
   → tenant comms-template library at /vault/<slug>/concierge-templates/
   → per event_type: select template; per recipient_role: candidate vs client
   → fallback: shared/common-comms-templates.yaml if tenant has no override
   → hh_decision_output("template_selected", "<event_type>:<recipient_role>",
     "template_id:<id>")

6. Sensitive-event escalation routing
   → if event_type=rejection (event 6) OR event_type=withdrawal (event 7)
     OR (event_type=on-hold AND placement value >£10k): set escalation_position=3
     (highest voice-classifier bar; mandatory consultant approval per autosend-policy)
   → else: escalation_position=1 (standard orange tier)
   → hh_decision_output("escalation_position_set", "candidate:<bullhorn_id>",
     "position:<N>")

7. LLM draft generation
   → prompt = (event context + candidate state history + voice corpus
     ANN-matched on event_type + tone rules filtered for concierge +
     comms-template structure)
   → output = email body + subject + recommended_send_time
   → write to /vault/<tenant>/concierge-drafts/<draft_id>.md
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if classifier <0.75 after 3 retries

8. Voice + tone validation
   → voice classifier scores the draft
   → minimum threshold by escalation_position:
     position 1: ≥0.75
     position 2: ≥0.78
     position 3 (rejections / sensitive): ≥0.82
   → tone-rule check (block-severity rules → ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION)
   → on success: hh_decision_action("concierge_email_draft",
     "<candidate_bullhorn_id>:<event_type>", payload_hash, payload_preview);
     tier=yellow per autosend-policy.yaml

9. SLA timing check (Gate B leading metric — NOT Gate A hard-fail)
   → elapsed = now() - event_timestamp
   → if elapsed > 30 minutes: ESC_CONCIERGE_SLA_MISS (warn; aggregate to Gate B)
   → per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 verbatim "every lifecycle event has a draft
     generated within 30 minutes" — interpreted as a Gate B leading metric
     (90% of drafts within 30 min) rather than per-draft hard fail (legitimate
     polling-fallback delays would otherwise block drafts entirely)

10. PII boundary check
    → no PII from other candidates referenced in body
    → no PII from competitor clients referenced
    → no compensation specifics outside what's already in candidate's record
    → ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK on hit (blocking)
    → hh_decision_output("pii_check_passed", "candidate:<bullhorn_id>",
     "result:passed")

11. Autosend-bridge routing (D1 path)
    → per Founder Decision D1 (final selection at W10 design):
      D1-A (bridge to cortextOS approval system): POST internal API
      D1-B (lightweight Telegram shim): send approval prompt to operator
      D1-C (no autosend in v1.0): draft to vault for manual consultant pickup
    → per autosend-policy.yaml: orange-tier; consultant approves
    → ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT if no approval within 24h (D1-A/B)

12. (After operator approval) Send execution — orange-tier
    → microsoft-graph.send_email() OR gmail.send_email() per tenant config
    → BCC: tenant's archive address (per tenant config)
    → hh_decision_action("gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate",
      "candidate:<bullhorn_id>", payload_hash, payload_preview)
      [or `bullhorn_note_customer_visible` if channel=Bullhorn-note]
    → ESC_SEND_FAIL on 4xx/5xx; retry once 30s backoff

13. Bullhorn activity-log write
    → bullhorn.create_activity_log(candidate_id, "concierge: <event_type>
      sent at <ISO>")
    → maintains audit trail in Bullhorn itself
    → hh_decision_output("bullhorn_activity_logged",
      "candidate:<bullhorn_id>", "event_type:<type>")

14. Lifecycle state advance (Bullhorn write, conditional)
    → some events trigger Bullhorn state changes (e.g., interview-completed
      sent → advances state to "post-interview" if tenant policy says so)
    → per-tenant policy; opt-in; not all tenants want this
    → hh_decision_action("concierge_send_complete", "candidate:<bullhorn_id>",
      payload_hash, "event=<type> elapsed=<seconds>")

15. Session close + Gate B metric
    → compute elapsed (event → send) for Gate B SLA tracking
    → check ghosted-rate metric (any candidate with no Concierge action in
      14 days post-state-change → contributes to ghosted-rate)
    → if ghosted-rate >5% for tenant in 30-day rolling: ESC_GATE_B_MISS
    → hh_decision_action("concierge_run_complete", session_id, run_mode)
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4 + ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566 (interpreted per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):

- **"voice classifier score ≥ position-specific threshold"** (≥0.75 position 1, ≥0.78 position 2, ≥0.82 position 3) — hard-fail
- **"correct addressee resolution (no candidates emailed under another's name)"** — hard-fail (Step 4 critical; ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH)
- No tone-rule block-severity violations — hard-fail (ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION)
- No PII outside firm boundary — hard-fail (ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK)
- Anti-duplicate guard passed (Step 2) — hard-fail (skip if true duplicate)
- All Bullhorn context fields present (no missing candidate name / no missing email) — hard-fail (ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE; ESC_CANDIDATE_DATA_INCOMPLETE is Sourcing Scout's per catalogue §2.10)

The 30-minute draft SLA (ULTRAPLAN A6 line 566) is interpreted as a Gate B leading metric (90% target) per §1 framing, NOT a per-draft Gate A hard-fail. Polling-fallback delays would otherwise block legitimate drafts. Per-draft SLA misses fire `ESC_CONCIERGE_SLA_MISS` (warn, aggregated).

Gate A failures fire `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` or `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION` or `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` or `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` (output-shape constraint — missing Bullhorn context OR voice threshold misses persistently) — all blocking; draft to `/tmp`; operator notified immediately.

**Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** Concierge `validate.sh` does NOT exist yet — this scaffold describes the intended Gate A contract for the W10-13 build slice. The W10-13 build delivers `agents/recruitment/concierge/validate.sh` against the contract above. Current text is the spec the build slice implements against, not a description of running code.

### Gate B — Outcome thresholds (success metrics, not block)

Per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 567 verbatim: **"<5% candidate-ghosted rate; ≥60% send-as-is rate on drafts"**.

Two metrics:
- **Ghosted-rate:** % of candidates with a lifecycle state change in the last 30 days who received no Concierge comm within 14 days of that change. Target <5%.
- **Send-as-is rate:** % of drafts approved by consultant without edits (consultant clicks "approve" not "edit-and-approve"). Target ≥60%. Measured via `recent_edit` rows with `resolution='approved_verbatim'` vs `approved_after_edit`.

Gate B doesn't block individual sends. Tracked monthly via the tenant's day-30 metrics roll-up. Both metrics below target for 30 consecutive days → `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` → founder + operator review (likely indicates LLM drift, lifecycle-event detection gaps, OR tenant-specific style mismatch).

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Concierge uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` | OAuth refresh fails (payload.failure_type='refresh_failed' or 'revoked_401' covers the 6+ consecutive failure case) | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | 429 from Bullhorn or email provider (payload.upstream identifies which) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_MS_GRAPH_AUTH` | Microsoft Graph OAuth fail | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall + tenant-admin (token re-auth required) |
| `ESC_GMAIL_AUTH` | Gmail OAuth fail | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall + tenant-admin |
| `ESC_LIFECYCLE_STATE_UNKNOWN` | Bullhorn state transition not in 12-event taxonomy | warn (handler logs + skips draft) | operator_chat_id |
| (Concierge does NOT use `ESC_CANDIDATE_DATA_INCOMPLETE` — per catalogue §2.10 that code is reserved for Sourcing Scout shortlist completeness. Concierge's missing-Bullhorn-context case fires `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` per Gate A discipline below.) | — | — |
| `ESC_ADDRESSEE_MISMATCH` | Step 4 critical — wrong recipient | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Voice classifier below position-specific threshold after 3 retries | warn (position 1-2) or **blocking** (position 3) | operator_chat_id (1-2) / operator + ifos_oncall (position 3) |
| `ESC_TONE_RULE_VIOLATION` | Block-severity tone rule hit | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_CONCIERGE_SLA_MISS` | Draft >30 min after lifecycle event | warn | (logged; aggregated to Gate B) |
| `ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` | No consultant approval within 24h | warn | operator + tenant-admin |
| `ESC_SEND_FAIL` | Email provider 4xx/5xx | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Gate A failure (output-shape constraint per catalogue line 184) — distinct from ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED which is for red-tier action attempts only | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_GATE_B_MISS` | Ghosted-rate >5% OR send-as-is <60% for 30 consecutive days | warn | founder + operator |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_ORANGE_PENDING` | Draft awaiting approval (info — heartbeat reminder when ≥50% of timeout elapsed) | info | (logged) |
| `ESC_AUTOSEND_SAMPLED_SPOT_CHECK` | Yellow/orange-tier sample row selected for audit | info | operator_chat_id |

Concierge has the largest escalation surface of any v1.0 agent — appropriate for the highest-stakes customer-facing comms.

Concierge does NOT use:

- `ESC_AUTOSEND_BLOCKED` — reserved for red-tier action attempts per catalogue line 41; Concierge has no red-tier actions. Gate A failures fire `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` instead.
- `ESC_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` — reserved for vertical-schema field-constraint violations at write time per catalogue line 163; Concierge's Gate A failures are output-shape or addressee-resolution failures.
- `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` (direct firing) — that's fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per catalogue §2.5; Concierge fires only per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT`.

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Steps 7-8 (draft generation + voice/tone validation) are the load-bearing voice surface of v1.0. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `concierge`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "We regret to inform you" boilerplate (rejection emails are the hardest test case per ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570; demand specificity)
  - No "Per our previous conversation" without referencing the actual conversation context
  - No urgency language ("URGENT", "ACT NOW") unless the lifecycle event genuinely requires it
  - No mention of other candidates by name
  - No salary/rate specifics outside what's already on the candidate's record
  - No competing-agency references
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks matching the specific event_type (e.g., "rejection email" task context surfaces rejection-style samples).
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` agent**: drift signal. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when a draft's voice classifier score is below the position-specific threshold after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` is fired by the nightly voice-drift cron per `escalation-codes.md` §2.5 (≥N `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant in rolling 7d window); Concierge does NOT fire `_TENANT` directly. Edit-distance metrics are tracked for analytics; they inform the canary's threshold tuning but do not fire ESC codes from Concierge.

**Position-specific thresholds:**
- Position 1 (standard sends — acknowledgement, prep, debrief, nurture): voice ≥0.75
- Position 2 (placement-positive, status-update): voice ≥0.78
- Position 3 (rejections, sensitive on-hold): voice ≥0.82 (ULTRAPLAN A6 line 570 explicitly names rejection voice as the hardest case)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Bullhorn A+B + per-tenant email-provider signups + D1 founder decision + Q1 LOI + W10-13 build slice.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | **D1 founder decision (autosend orange-tier path)** — A (bridge to cortextOS), B (Telegram shim), C (no autosend; manual). Concierge ABSOLUTELY needs this resolved before build. | Founder decision per `docs/decisions/2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md` §D1. Recommend D1-B (Telegram shim) for v1.0 ship; D1-A as v1.1 upgrade. |
| Q2 | Lifecycle event taxonomy — 12 events proposed in §3. Founder confidence each is correct + complete? Missing: "candidate referred to another role internally"? "Client cancelled brief"? | Founder review with first pilot consultants. Recommend: ship 12-event v1.0; expand v1.1+ based on real patterns. |
| Q3 | Sending hours per tenant — should Concierge respect tenant's "no sends after 6pm" or "no weekend sends" policies? Per-tenant config? | Per-tenant config in `tenant_adapters.config.concierge_send_window` (default: M-F 09:00-17:00 tenant-timezone). |
| Q4 | Rejection emails (event 6) — Position 3 (voice ≥0.82). Is this enough, or should rejections route to consultant for full draft (not just approve)? | Founder review with first pilot consultant. Recommend: Concierge drafts; consultant approves; never bypasses voice gate. |
| Q5 | Comms-template customisation — every tenant edits these. Per-event-type, per-recipient-role × per-tenant = 24+ templates each. Authoring tool? | v1.0: Markdown files at `/vault/<slug>/concierge-templates/<event>-<role>.md`. v1.1: Brain UI WYSIWYG editor. |
| Q6 | Send-as-is rate (Gate B ≥60%) — measurement requires consultant to differentiate "approve" from "edit-and-approve". Brain UI v1.0 has no such control yet. Telegram-based approval? | Telegram-based for v1.0: `/approve <draft-id>` vs `/approve-edit <draft-id> <revised-body>`. Brain UI v1.1+ adds inline edit UX. |
| Q7 | Anti-duplicate guard window — 24h proposed in Step 2. Edge case: webhook + poll cycle both fire same event within 5 min → second skipped. What if first failed silently? | Anti-duplicate also checks decision_log for `phase='action'` not just `phase='trigger'` — if first didn't send, second can attempt. |
| Q8 | agent-identity email adapter (deferred) (v1.1+) — agent-identity sends. Should Concierge use agent-identity email adapter (deferred) for rejection emails (less personal pressure on consultant approving) or always tenant-identity? | v1.0: tenant-identity (Microsoft Graph / Gmail). v1.1+: agent-identity email adapter (deferred) experiment per tenant opt-in. |
| Q9 | Cross-tenant lifecycle handling — what if a candidate placed at Tenant A's client interviews at Tenant B 6 weeks later? Bullhorn has separate tenant slugs; no cross-tenant leak. But operator visibility? | v1.0: strict tenant isolation (no cross-tenant data visibility). v1.1+: separate agent for tenant-network-graph if commercial demand. |
| Q10 | 90-day check-in (event 12) — relationship-building tone. Should Concierge also surface "anyone in your network looking?" referral request? | Founder review with first pilot consultant + tenant brand voice. Recommend: opt-in via tenant config. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from ULTRAPLAN A6 line 569-570)

1. **Lifecycle event detection from Bullhorn is the unreliable bit.** Bullhorn's webhook coverage is patchy; polling fallbacks are required. Step 1 polling at 5-min cycle + anti-duplicate guard at Step 2 is the architecture.
2. **Voice quality on rejections is the hardest test case.** Position-3 threshold (≥0.82) + sensitive-event escalation routing (Step 6). Get this wrong and it costs the tenant a candidate relationship.
3. **Comms-template library is per-tenant, per-event-type, per-recipient-role.** 24+ templates per tenant minimum. Authoring effort is significant; consider this in pilot onboarding scoping.
4. **Microsoft Graph vs Gmail per-tenant** — each tenant chooses based on their existing email stack. v1.0 supports both; v1.1+ may add agent-identity email adapter (deferred).

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` skill (built Day 19, commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md ratifies when Codex Round 4 Phase 2 (Day 20) returns RATIFIED verdict.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex Round 4 Phase 2 ratifies
- **Founder Decision D1 RESOLVED** (Q1 above) — without this, Concierge build cannot start
- Founder approves §9 Q2 (lifecycle taxonomy) + Q3 (send window) + Q4 (rejection routing) + Q5 (template authoring UX) + Q6 (Gate B UX)
- Q7-Q9 documented decisions captured

Status flips Accepted → In Force when:
- W10-13 build slice produces all 5 sibling bundle files + 5 fixtures (broader fixture coverage warranted by XL complexity)
- First production lifecycle webhook processed end-to-end against migration-test tenant
- 12-event taxonomy validated against first pilot tenant's actual Bullhorn state-change patterns
- Voice classifier microservice production-ready (per-tenant; position-3 ≥0.82 sustained)
- Gate B feedback loop operational (consultant approve/edit distinguishable)
- Codex re-ratifies post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Concierge is the most complex v1.0 agent; its ratification cycles may surface architectural decisions not visible at scaffold stage. Founder review at each iteration is expected.
