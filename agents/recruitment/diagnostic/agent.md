# Diagnostic — the sales tool

**Status:** Proposed (Day-11 pre-W3-build draft; awaits Q1 LOI + Codex ratification at first render).
**Date:** 2026-05-22.
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code.
**Build wave:** v1.0 W3-4 per master brief §8.2 row 1 (anchor wave). First v1.0 agent; first production render exercise of the renderer at `packages/agent-renderer/`.
**Build complexity:** M (1 week) per Ultraplan §8.1 A1.
**Tier:** 2 (request-driven; no persistent PTY) per sequencing-target.md §2.1.

---

## §1 — Output contract (one-paragraph screenshot)

Per master brief §1 Rule 1, the output contract is the load-bearing first thing. Read this in isolation; everything else in this document supports it.

> **Diagnostic produces a single Markdown report at `/vault/<tenant>/diagnostic-reports/<firm-slug>-<ISO-date>.md`** that diagnoses one named UK firm's recruitment-buying signals. The report has exactly **12 sections** (enumerated in §3 below). Each section MUST contain at least **one** evidence link (Companies House URL, LinkedIn URL, or careers-page URL) — Gate A hard-fails on any section missing its citation. (Per-claim citation validation is a W4 polish item; the v0 contract requires per-section coverage as a tractable Gate-A check.) The report ends with a **2-3 sentence conversation opener** written in the consultant's voice (voice-classifier ≥ 0.75 per `common-voice.json`) suitable for cold outreach to the firm's hiring decision-maker. **No external sends** — Diagnostic writes to vault only; consultant reads + uses for prospect calls or directly pastes the conversation opener into LinkedIn/email manually. Typical report length: 600-1000 words. Gate B (success threshold): ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports result in a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation (per Ultraplan §8.1 A1).

---

## §2 — Invocation surface

### CLI (v1.0)

```bash
# Manual consultant invocation, run from anywhere
ifosctl diagnostic \
  --firm "Charterhouse Partners" \
  --sector "fintech" \                  # optional; helps tighten ICP fit scoring
  --tenant <slug>                       # which tenant's target_patch + voice corpus to use
  --notify-via telegram                 # optional; pings consultant when done
```

Resolved by cortextOS daemon → spawns Diagnostic in Tier-2 batch mode (no persistent PTY) → exits within 10-15 min per Ultraplan §8.1 A1 turnaround target.

### v1.1+ surfaces (deferred)

- Brain UI "Diagnose Firm" button → triggers via internal API
- Telegram bot command (`@ifos_bot diagnose Charterhouse Partners`)
- Bulk-mode (`ifosctl diagnostic --firm-list firms.csv`) — out of v1.0 scope

---

## §3 — The 12 required sections

Every report MUST contain these 12 sections in order. Gate A enforces section count + per-section citation.

| # | Section | What it contains | Source(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Firm signal** | Companies House data: registered name, company number, incorporation date, latest filed accounts (revenue band + headcount band), registered office, recent director changes, share-class moves | Companies House API |
| 2 | **Online footprint** | Primary website URL + last-updated signal; LinkedIn company page URL + follower count + last-post recency; careers page URL + state (active / placeholder / 404) | Web scraper (HEAD + first 200 lines); LinkedIn company-page fetch |
| 3 | **Sector + role-type mix** | Sectors actively recruiting for (extracted from current job posts); ratio of permanent vs contract roles in last 90 days; technical-vs-commercial-vs-operational split | LinkedIn job posts + careers page job listings |
| 4 | **Geography** | Office locations + current hiring locations + remote-vs-onsite-vs-hybrid mix | LinkedIn job posts (location field) + Companies House registered office |
| 5 | **Deal-size band proxy** | Salary bands or day-rate ranges visible in job posts; level distribution (junior / mid / senior / executive); recent placements visible via LinkedIn employees-of-firm field changes | LinkedIn job posts + LinkedIn employee timeline scan |
| 6 | **ICP fit vs target_patch** | Score 0-100 against tenant's `target_patch.json` (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band_gbp from `common-target-patch.json`). Includes named matches/mismatches per dimension | Tenant config + sections 1-5 above |
| 7 | **Tech stack signals** | Technologies named in JDs + LinkedIn skills aggregated from current employees + tools mentioned in director posts | LinkedIn JDs + LinkedIn employee profiles |
| 8 | **Pain signals** | Phrases on careers page suggesting urgency ("rapid growth", "we're scaling fast", "looking to triple the team"); LinkedIn director posts mentioning hiring pressure or "we need help"; Glassdoor reviews mentioning workload/burnout (if accessible) | Careers page scrape + LinkedIn director post search + optional Glassdoor scrape |
| 9 | **Competitor positioning** | Other recruitment firms visible in the candidate flow: LinkedIn employee profiles showing previous-employer agency names; @firm tags in LinkedIn recruitment-agency posts; LinkedIn "Who's hiring this firm" inference where visible | LinkedIn profile scrapes + agency-tag search |
| 10 | **Recent activity** | LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + summary); press releases or news mentions (basic Google search); funding events visible on Companies House (share allotments, new director appointments) | LinkedIn company page + Google web search + Companies House filing history |
| 11 | **Decision-maker map** | Named people likely to be buyers: head of talent / chief people officer / hiring manager equivalents. LinkedIn profile URL per person. Tenure at firm. Recent activity. | LinkedIn employee search filtered by title |
| 12 | **Conversation opener** | 2-3 sentence cold outreach pitch. Tailored to surfaced pain signals (§8). Written in consultant's voice (voice-classified). Includes specific evidence anchor (e.g., "I noticed you've doubled engineering headcount in 6 months based on your LinkedIn — congrats on the Series A. Curious how you're handling sourcing pressure at that pace.") | LLM-generated; voice-classified against tenant style guide |

**Gate A hard-fails:**

- Fewer than 12 sections present
- Any section with zero citation links
- Section 12 (conversation opener) failing voice-classifier with score < 0.75
- Output exceeds 2000 words OR is under 400 words (length-discipline boundary)

---

## §4 — Workflow

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2, every workflow step that produces output OR takes action MUST call `hh_decision_*` from `agents/_shared/hook-helpers.sh`.

```
0. Session start — invocation arrives via CLI ifosctl diagnostic
   → context.sh hydrates: voice corpus + tone rules + recent edits + target_patch.json
   → hh_decision_trigger("session_start", firm_name + sector_hint)

1. Validate input
   → validate.sh checks: firm name non-empty, sector (if provided) in known list,
     tenant_slug present, voice corpus reachable
   → Gate A: hard-fail if any check fails
   → ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL if firm name malformed (new code added to catalogue this round)

2. Companies House lookup (Section 1)
   → companies_house_lookup(firm_name) via Companies House MCP connector
   → cache result for 7 days per gotcha §6 (rate-limit discipline)
   → extract: registration + revenue band + headcount band + directors + share moves
   → ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT if Companies House returns 429 (back off 60s, retry once)

3. Online footprint discovery (Section 2)
   → web HEAD + first 200 lines fetch on probable URLs:
     {firm}.com / {firm}.co.uk / linkedin.com/company/{slug}
   → LinkedIn company-page fetch (Proxycurl or similar)
   → record careers page state + last-updated signal

4. Job posts harvest (Sections 3 + 4 + 5 + 7)
   → LinkedIn job posts API (filtered to firm) — up to 50 most recent
   → careers page scrape if accessible
   → extract: sector, role type, location, salary band, tech stack
   → Gotcha §6: store summarised data only; do not retain raw profiles per LinkedIn ToS

5. Director + employee scan (Sections 7 + 11)
   → LinkedIn search for {firm} employees with titles matching head-of-talent / chro / chief people / hiring-manager / talent-acquisition variants
   → record name + URL + tenure + recent activity
   → max 10 named people; deduplicate

6. Pain signal extraction (Section 8)
   → regex pass over careers-page + LinkedIn director posts for:
     - urgency phrases ("rapid growth", "scaling fast", "we need", "tripling", "doubling")
     - frustration phrases (Glassdoor if accessible: "overworked", "burnout", "no support")
     - hiring-pressure phrases ("desperately seeking", "high-priority hire", "must hire by")
   → record each match with quote + source URL + context

7. ICP fit scoring (Section 6)
   → load tenant target_patch from common-target-patch.json
   → score each dimension (sectors / geographies / size_bands / deal_size_band)
   → composite score 0-100 + per-dimension breakdown
   → no external action; compute only

8. Recent activity scan (Section 10)
   → LinkedIn company posts in last 90 days (count + first 100 chars of each)
   → basic Google search for "{firm} announcement OR funding OR acquisition" last 90 days
   → Companies House filing history last 90 days

9. Conversation opener generation (Section 12)
   → LLM prompt: context = §1-§11 of the report (esp. §8 pain signals);
                 constraint = consultant voice (hh_load_voice_samples for top-5 ANN match);
                 constraint = tone rules (hh_load_tone_rules)
   → output 2-3 sentences with at least one evidence anchor
   → voice classifier scores the output against tenant style guide
   → ESC_VOICE_DRIFT if score < 0.75 after 3 retries

10. Markdown report assembly
    → render report from sections 1-12 using Diagnostic-specific template
    → write to /vault/{tenant_slug}/diagnostic-reports/{firm-slug}-{ISO-date}.md
    → hh_decision_output("diagnostic_report", "<path>", "12-section report on {firm}")

11. Operator notification (optional, per --notify-via flag)
    → if telegram: send via primitive 5 with report path + executive summary (first 200 chars)
      → hh_decision_action("operator_notify_telegram", "operator:{chat_id}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
      → action tier per autosend-policy.yaml: green (operator-only Telegram; no customer-facing comms)
    → if no flag: silent completion (consultant checks vault) — no decision-log row needed

12. Session close
    → hh_decision_action("diagnostic_report_render", "firm:{slug}", payload_hash, payload_preview)
    → action tier per autosend-policy.yaml: green (no external send; vault write only)
    → exit code 0
```

## §5 — Gates

### Gate A — validate.sh (hard-fail before action)

Per master brief §8.1 Change 2 + autosend-safety-policy §4. Diagnostic's `validate.sh` enforces the following SPEC. **Honesty note (per bilateral-disposition Cat-5):** the v0 `validate.sh` at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` implements most of these checks today but warns-only on two upstream-unavailable cases (voice-classifier URL unreachable, firm-domain whitelist absent). Hard-fail behaviour on those two cases is a W4 polish item; current v0 honesty-flags them in `decision_log` payload with `validate_check_skipped=true` instead of hard-failing. The spec below describes the W4-complete contract; the W4 build slice closes the two gaps.

- All 12 sections present in the assembled report (count + heading check) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- Every section has ≥ 1 markdown link (regex `\[.+\]\(.+\)` per section) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- Section 12 voice classifier score ≥ 0.75 (`hh_load_voice_samples` returns ANN match + classifier; score computed via tenant's voice classifier per Ultraplan §5.3) — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if voice-classifier URL unreachable; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**
- Report length 400-2000 words — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- No banned phrases per `tone_rule` table (`hh_load_tone_rules` filter) — **v0: hard-fails as specified**
- No PII outside the firm boundary (regex pass for emails/phones that don't match `{firm}.com` or known director email patterns) — fires `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` immediately on hit — **v0: warns + flags `validate_check_skipped=true` if firm-domain whitelist absent; W4 polish closes to hard-fail**

### Gate B — Outcome threshold (success metric, not block)

Per Ultraplan §8.1 A1: ≥ 30% of Diagnostic reports lead to a discovery call booked within 14 days of generation. Measured by consultant feedback loop — Telegram reply `/diagnostic-feedback <report-id> booked|not-booked` (v1.0) or Brain UI button (v1.1). Aggregated as `decision_log` rows with `agent_name='diagnostic'` + `phase='action'` + `payload.action_type='consultant_feedback'`; outcome metric computed by Gate-B rollup query at the weekly review (not stored as a single `decision_log.payload` field). Sentinel agent_names (`_renderer`, `_tenant_admin`, `_codex_ratifier`) are reserved for system actors — consultant feedback is conceptually Diagnostic's domain (validating Diagnostic's output), so the firing agent_name is `diagnostic` with a payload action_type marker rather than a new sentinel.

Gate B is a local leading metric for Diagnostic quality; it does NOT feed any v1.0 kill-criterion trigger directly. (Per bilateral-disposition Cat-3 at `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md`: kill-criterion §2 Trigger 8 is revenue uplift after 3 completed pilots, not Diagnostic conversion. A separate agent-specific Trigger 11 may be added in v1.1 if conversion-driven scope cuts become operationally relevant.) Below 30% sustained for 4 weeks → revisit Diagnostic's output quality at next Sunday review.

---

## §6 — Escalation codes

Diagnostic uses these ESC codes from `agents/_shared/escalation-codes.md`:

| Code | Trigger | Severity | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` | Section 12 voice classifier < 0.75 after 3 retries | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_PII_LEAKAGE_RISK` | PII detected outside firm boundary | **blocking** | operator + ifos_oncall |
| `ESC_RATE_LIMIT_HIT` | Companies House or LinkedIn 429 | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL` | Malformed firm name input (Step 1 validation) | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` | Section count != 12 OR Gate-A per-section citation missing | warn | operator_chat_id |
| `ESC_RENDERER_FAILED` | (not Diagnostic's concern; renderer escalation only) | — | — |

Diagnostic does NOT use:

- `ESC_BULLHORN_AUTH` — Diagnostic never touches Bullhorn (per sequencing-target.md §2.1)
- `ESC_AUTOSEND_*` — Diagnostic's only action is `diagnostic_report_render` (green tier per autosend-policy.yaml)
- `ESC_VAULT_*` — Diagnostic writes to one file per invocation; no concurrent-write contention

---

## §7 — Voice + tone constraints

Section 12 (conversation opener) is voice-classified. The agent integrates with `_shared/voice-loader.sh`:

- **`hh_load_tone_rules` filtered by `applies_to_agents` containing `diagnostic`** — surfaces rules like:
  - No "I hope this finds you well" or other generic openers
  - No salary or commission anchors in cold outreach
  - Specific evidence anchor required (not generic "great company")
- **`hh_load_voice_samples` ANN query against tenant's voice_corpus**: top-5 chunks closest to current task context (cold-outreach-to-recruitment-firm-decision-maker). Feeds LLM prompt as voice exemplars.
- **`hh_load_recent_edits` last 30 days for `concierge` + `diagnostic`**: surfaces patterns of how consultant edits agent drafts. Per-run `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` fires when the §12 voice classifier score is below 0.75 after 3 retries. Aggregate `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT` fires per `escalation-codes.md` ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT trigger — ≥5 `ESC_VOICE_DRIFT` rows from the same tenant within a rolling 7-day window (per the nightly voice-drift cron). Edit-distance metrics are tracked separately for analytics but do NOT fire ESC_VOICE_DRIFT_TENANT directly.

Per master brief §8.1 Change 1: voice is per-tenant; never cross-tenant.

## §8 — Build dependencies (W3 prerequisites)

Diagnostic build cannot start until ALL of the following are confirmed:

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer + `_shared/` substrate | Day-8 + Round-3 commits | ✅ Ratified (Round 3) |
| Live VPS migration applied | `bash scripts/run-live-migration.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Tenancy audit passes 12 invariants | `bash scripts/run-tenancy-audit.sh` | ⏸ Founder action |
| Q1 design partner LOI signed | Risk #3 + kill-criterion §2 Trigger 1 | ⏸ Jack's lane |
| `target_patch.json` for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI (per tenant-lifecycle.md §2) |
| Voice corpus seeded for the first pilot tenant | Pilot onboarding | ⏸ Post-LOI |
| Companies House MCP connector | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| LinkedIn read-only MCP connector (or Proxycurl wrapper) | Build at W3 start (~2 days) | ⏸ Not built |
| Web scraper utility (HEAD + first-N-lines) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `validate.sh` Gate A logic (12-section check) | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| `context.sh` hydration | Build at W3 start (~0.5 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| 3 fixtures with golden outputs (01-primary + 02-edge-case-no-online-footprint + 99-voice-drift-canary) | Build at W3 start (~1 day) | ⏸ Not built |
| Codex ratification of full agent bundle | Post-build via `review-agent-bundle.md` skill | ✅ Skill built Day 19 (`.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md`) |

**Until ALL ratified items have ⏸ → ✅, W3 build slice does not start.**

---

## §9 — Status + open questions

**Status:** Proposed. Awaits Q1 LOI + first pilot tenant onboarded + W3 build slice start.

**Recommended ratification path:** Author the agent.md draft (this document) Day 11 — frees W3 build to focus on the other 5 bundle files + 3 fixtures, not iterating on output contract under W3 deadline pressure. Founder reviews this draft when convenient; refinements drop in commits between Day 11 and W3 start.

### Open questions for founder review

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Is "12 sections" the right number? Ultraplan §8.1 A1 says "12 required sections" but doesn't enumerate. This document proposes a 12-section list (§3); founder may want to revise. | Founder reviews §3 table; can split/merge sections. Lands as Edit in next commit. |
| Q2 | Should §11 (decision-maker map) be a separate section OR rolled into §3 + §4 + §5 + §7 as a sub-row? Currently named as a separate section. | Founder review at agent.md ratification. |
| Q3 | Proxycurl vs alternative LinkedIn API surface? Cost + ToS implications. | Resolved at W3 start before Companies House + LinkedIn MCP connectors authored. Founder + Claude decide together. |
| Q4 | Gate B (30% discovery-call-to-report ratio) measured how? Manual tagging by consultant OR auto-detection via Bullhorn calendar links? | v1.0 manual tagging via Telegram resolution; v1.1 auto-detection. |
| Q5 | What's the "firm-slug" canonical form for the output filename? Companies House registration number? URL-slugified firm name? | Recommend Companies House number for stability; canonical-slug fallback for non-UK firms (v1.1+). |
| Q6 | Should §10 (recent activity) include Glassdoor reviews? ToS implications. | Per gotcha §6 below: caution; default OFF for v1.0; explicit founder enable for v1.1+. |

### Gotchas (carried forward from Ultraplan §8.1 A1)

1. **LinkedIn ToS — cannot store profile data beyond the audit.** Profile fetches are cached only for the duration of the report generation (typ. 10-15 min). After report writes to vault, raw profile data is dropped from agent memory + no persistence in Postgres.
2. **Companies House rate limits — cache aggressively.** Free tier is 600 requests per 5-minute window per IP. Cache responses for 7 days per (company_number) key. Pre-emptive 60s backoff on first 429.
3. **Glassdoor scraping — uncertain ToS compatibility.** Default OFF for v1.0. Per Q6 above.

---

## §10 — When this document ratifies

Per `.codex/ratification/review-agent-bundle.md` (skill built Day 19; commit `825ebd4`): this agent.md plus the 5 sibling bundle files plus 3 fixtures ratify as a unit at W3 build end.

Status flips to Accepted when:
- Codex Round-3+ ratifies the full bundle
- Founder approves §3's 12-section list as canonical
- First production render against the first pilot tenant succeeds (per ADR-003 §4 + ADR-004 Decision 7 audit row)
- Gate B baseline measurement begins (30% target; 4-week window)

Until then: this document is a forward-looking scaffold. Conservative pre-build clarity — not a binding contract until ratification.

*End of Diagnostic agent.md draft.*
