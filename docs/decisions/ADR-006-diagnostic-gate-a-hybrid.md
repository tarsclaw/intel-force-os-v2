# ADR-006 — Diagnostic Gate A hybrid (per-section v0 + per-claim W4 spot-check)

**Status:** Proposed (2026-05-24, Day 19; ULTRAPLAN in-band amendment landed at commit `aed9d3b` as forward-looking placeholder text pending this ADR's ratification — if Codex REJECTS and founder doesn't accept, the ULTRAPLAN line 496 inline parenthetical reverts in the rollback commit; Status flips to Accepted when BOTH (a) Codex RATIFIED verdict AND (b) Diagnostic agent.md §1 + §5 explicitly cite ADR-006 — both conditions per §Status criteria below)
**Author:** Founder (Maddox) + Claude Code
**Amends:** `docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md` §8.1 A1 line 496 — Gate A citation requirement
**Ratifies via:** `.codex/ratification/review-architecture-decision.md` Codex skill
**Driven by:** `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` Phase 4 Cat-ζ — Codex re-flags Cat-1 every round because bilateral-disposition docs are not auto-trusted as in-band Gate A acceptances; the canonical authoritative path for upstream-spec amendments is an ADR

---

## Context

ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1 line 496 (pre-amendment wording — before this ADR's in-band edit landed in commit `aed9d3b`):

> - **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data

Current line 496 (post-amendment; live as of commit `aed9d3b`):

> - **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data *(see `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` — per-section citation subcheck is hard-fail at v0; per-claim quality signal is a separate post-launch metric outside Gate A; voice classifier + PII subchecks remain per current `validate.sh`)*

The "no claims unsupported by source data" clause implies **per-claim citation validation** — every factual claim in the report must have a backing source link. The Diagnostic v0 implementation at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` enforces **per-section citation** (regex `\[.+\]\(.+\)` requires ≥1 markdown link per section); per-claim validation is NOT implemented at v0.

(Voice classifier ≥ 0.75 and PII boundary checks are also Gate A requirements per the same v0 contract. Their v0 implementation in `validate.sh` is partial — `validate.sh` warns and emits `validate_check_skipped=true` when the voice-classifier URL is unreachable or the firm-domain whitelist is absent, rather than hard-failing; W4-polish closes these to hard-fail per `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md` §5 honesty note. These warn-only-paths exist in v0 but are not affected by this ADR; this ADR addresses ONLY the "no claims unsupported by source data" clause from line 496.)

This creates a documented gap between the upstream spec and the v0 implementation. Codex Round 4-9 has flagged this as "Gate A weakens ULTRAPLAN source-data requirement" across 10 ratification rounds (see `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` Round 9 Diagnostic finding #1). Per-claim citation validation requires:

1. NLP claim-extraction from the rendered Markdown report (sentence-level fact identification)
2. Per-claim evidence-link matching (semantic similarity between claim and cited URL content)
3. Confidence threshold tuning to avoid false rejections of well-cited paraphrases

This is genuinely hard engineering work — single-week W3 build slice cannot deliver it correctly. The honest options are: (a) defer Diagnostic v0 launch until per-claim validation lands (likely W6+ before any pilot tenant sees a Diagnostic report — pushes past Trigger 2 firing date 2026-06-14), (b) launch v0 with per-section validation + W4 polish for per-claim spot-check sampling, (c) amend ULTRAPLAN to match v0 implementation reality.

Bilateral founder+Claude session on 2026-05-24 (Day 19) selected option **(b) — hybrid framing** as the disposition (Cat-1 in the disagreement doc). Founder authorization via AskUserQuestion accepted: "Hybrid (Recommended): v0 = per-section, W4 = per-claim spot-check".

This ADR formalises that disposition as a ratified architectural decision so future Codex rounds + agent.md §5 framing treat it as upstream-canonical, not as a downstream weakening.

## Decision

### Decision 1 — Diagnostic Gate A citation validation is per-section coverage ONLY (hard-fail)

Every one of the 12 sections in the rendered Diagnostic Markdown report MUST contain ≥1 evidence link (markdown link of the form `[label](url)`). Implemented at `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` via regex check per section heading. Hard-fail on miss → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE`. **The per-section citation subcheck has no warn-only paths** (full implementation; hard-fail at v0). This satisfies Rule 4 (Quality gates before features) for the per-section subcheck — Gate A's section-citation requirement is unambiguously hard-fail; the upstream ULTRAPLAN clause "no claims unsupported by source data" is interpreted at Gate A as "every section has at least one evidence link", consistent with the implementation.

The OTHER Gate A subchecks (voice classifier ≥ 0.75 and PII boundary) have v0 warn-only paths when upstream services are unreachable (voice-classifier URL down, firm-domain whitelist absent) — these are honesty-flagged with `validate_check_skipped=true` per the Context section above. W4-polish closes those subchecks to hard-fail. This ADR addresses only the per-section citation subcheck of Gate A; it does NOT modify the voice classifier or PII subchecks.

### Decision 2 — Per-claim citation validation is a SEPARATE post-launch quality metric (NOT Gate A)

The per-claim citation pipeline (NLP claim-extraction + per-claim evidence-link matching + aggregate quality metric) is **explicitly outside Gate A** in v1.0. It lands as:

- A separate post-launch Diagnostic quality signal — analogous to Gate B's outcome threshold (30% discovery-call conversion) but for citation quality
- Authored as a separate W4 ADR (number to be assigned at W4-polish authoring time; this ADR does NOT pre-assign a number) together with the schema supplements that define its payload key + per-tenant config field
- Sampling-based (1-in-N) post-launch quality monitoring; warn-level; never blocks v0 sends
- Activates after voice classifier microservice ships + first pilot tenant accumulates ≥30 Diagnostic reports

**Rule 2 (Schema before code) satisfied:** the schema work for the per-claim quality metric (payload key + per-tenant config field) lands in the future W4 ADR's supplements before any code reads/writes those fields. This ADR-006 does NOT introduce schema fields; it only specifies Gate A as per-section hard-fail.

**Rule 4 (Quality gates before features) satisfied for the per-section citation subcheck:** it is hard-fail at v0 with no warn-only paths. (Other Gate A subchecks — voice classifier + PII — retain v0 warn-only paths when upstream services are unreachable per Context note; W4-polish closes those. ADR-006 addresses only the per-section subcheck.) Per-claim quality is a separate signal, not a weakening of Gate A's per-section subcheck.

## ULTRAPLAN amendment

`docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md` §8.1 A1 line 496 reads (verbatim, before this ADR):

> - **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data

After this ADR ratifies, the canonical interpretation is:

> **Gate A (per ADR-006):** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link — per-section citation subcheck is hard-fail (no warn-only paths). The ULTRAPLAN clause "no claims unsupported by source data" is interpreted at Gate A as "every section has at least one evidence link"; per-claim citation analysis is a SEPARATE post-launch quality metric outside Gate A (a W4 ADR to be authored at first-pilot polish time).

**In-band amendment (landed in commit `aed9d3b`):** `docs/specs/ULTRAPLAN.md` line 496 now reads verbatim:

> - **Gate A:** report contains all 12 required sections; each section has at least 1 evidence link; no claims unsupported by source data *(see `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` — per-section citation subcheck is hard-fail at v0; per-claim quality signal is a separate post-launch metric outside Gate A; voice classifier + PII subchecks remain per current `validate.sh`)*

This is the explicit in-band amendment Codex `review-architecture-decision` ratification path requires — reviewers consulting ULTRAPLAN §8.1 A1 see the pointer to ADR-006 directly in the source line. The amendment landed alongside the ADR-006 R2 fix commit, not in a future commit.

## Why hybrid not full-spec

**Why not (a) defer launch until per-claim lands?**
- Trigger 2 (DIAGNOSTIC-NO-RENDER-W3 KILL per `docs/decisions/v1.0-kill-criterion.md` §Trigger 2 line 63 threshold: "Diagnostic agent does not render cleanly via `ifos-render-agent render diagnostic` by end of Week 3 (2026-06-14)... renderer exits 0, no ESC_RENDERER_FAILED rows in decision_log, validate.sh passes against all three fixtures") fires in 21 days from Day 19. Validate.sh is part of the Trigger 2 success criterion; deferring per-claim validation work into validate.sh would extend the build slice past 2026-06-14 with high confidence (per-claim NLP pipeline + tuning ≈ 6 weeks)
- A working v0 with per-section validation has measurable Gate A coverage; deferring means no Gate A at all in the meantime, which is strictly worse
- The 30%-discovery-call Gate B target is independent of per-claim validation; pilot value is reachable without it

**Why not (c) amend ULTRAPLAN downward permanently?**
- The per-claim requirement is genuinely valuable for v1.1+ once the NLP pipeline exists
- Permanently removing it from ULTRAPLAN loses the documented quality bar
- Hybrid preserves the W4-polish path; permanent amendment closes that door

**Why hybrid is honest signal (Rule 5):**
- v0 implementation does what it says; W4 polish path is documented + scheduled
- Codex flags become explicit-disposition references (this ADR) not unaddressed weakening
- Pilot tenants reading Gate A spec see the v0 contract clearly + the W4 expansion plan

## Consequences

### Immediate (this ADR commit)

- `docs/decisions/ADR-006-diagnostic-gate-a-hybrid.md` (this file) lands as Proposed
- `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/validate.sh` retains current per-section enforcement (no implementation change)

### Next commit (after this ADR ratifies)

- `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md` §1 + §5 framing edited to explicitly reference ADR-006 (Tier 1 hard-fail / Tier 2 W4 polish per-claim spot-check). NOT yet present in agent.md as of this commit; lands in the post-ratify commit.
- `docs/decisions/2026-05-18-codex-ratification-manifest.md` queue updated to include this ADR. NOT yet updated as of this commit; lands in the post-ratify commit.

### After Codex ratifies this ADR (Status flips Proposed → Accepted)

- Codex Round 10+ on Diagnostic agent.md should accept the Gate A framing because the upstream contract is now this ADR (not the original ULTRAPLAN line 496 prose alone)
- Other agents (Janitor, Scribe, Cash Conductor, Sourcing Scout, Concierge) Gate A framings can follow the same per-agent ADR pattern (numbers assigned at authoring time, not pre-reserved here) if needed for their own Cat-ζ findings — though most other agents' Gate A is implementation-realistic at v0, so this may not be needed

### W4-polish slice (after voice-classifier microservice ships + first pilot tenant data accumulates)

- Per-claim spot-check pipeline lands as Tier 2 validate.sh extension
- Sample rate configurable per tenant via field landing in v0.3 vertical-schema supplement (concrete field name + type specified there, not in this ADR)
- Aggregate metric writes to `decision_log.payload` via key landing in autosend-safety-policy §7 supplement (concrete key name specified there, not in this ADR)
- Threshold breach → `ESC_AGENT_OUTPUT_SHAPE` warn (info-only; no block)

### Downstream artefact references (queued for post-ratify commit)

- `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md` §1 → will cite "Per ADR-006, Gate A is two-tier..."
- `agents/recruitment/diagnostic/agent.md` §5 → will cite "Tier 1 hard-fail (per-section); Tier 2 W4 polish (per-claim spot-check) per ADR-006"
- `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-05-24-diagnostic-gate-a.md` Phase 4 Cat-ζ section → references ADR-006 as the closure mechanism (already cross-referenced in commit `1f8c92f`)
- `docs/decisions/2026-05-18-codex-ratification-manifest.md` → adds this ADR as ratification queue item

These edits all land in the next commit AFTER this ADR ratifies (no point updating agent.md to cite a Proposed ADR; cite once ratified).

## Open questions

| # | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Default sample rate for Tier 2 spot-check? Recommend 1-in-10 (~10% of reports validated per-claim) for first pilot; adjust based on early signal | Founder review at first-pilot W4 polish landing |
| Q2 | NLP claim-extraction library — what's the right tool? (spaCy + custom rules / Claude API-based extraction / hosted service) | W4 polish technical investigation; cost vs accuracy tradeoff |
| Q3 | Per-claim confidence threshold — 0.6 in this ADR is a starting point; calibrate against pilot data | W4 polish empirical tuning with first-pilot consultant feedback |

## Status

**Proposed.** Awaits Codex ratification via `review-architecture-decision.md` skill.

Status flips Proposed → Accepted when:
- Codex returns RATIFIED for this ADR
- Diagnostic agent.md §1 + §5 cite ADR-006 explicitly (next commit)

*End of ADR-006.*
