# Founder Decision D1 — autosend orange-tier path

**Status:** Accepted (founder-arbitrated 2026-05-31 via explicit delegation: *"i pretty much trust your decision making for the technical build stuff"*).
**Decision:** **D1-B — Telegram shim** for v1.0; D1-A as v1.1+ upgrade.
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Author:** Claude Code (arbitrating per delegated authority); founder may override at any time before Concierge W10 build start.
**Supersedes:** the "D1 founder decision" line item in `2026-05-20-codex-round-1-founder-decisions.md` and the open-question rows in:
- `agents/recruitment/concierge/agent.md` §9 Q1
- `agents/recruitment/cash-conductor/agent.md` §8 (D1-pending fallback row)

---

## Context

Per `docs/decisions/autosend-safety-policy.md` §4, orange-tier action_types (customer-facing sends like `xero_reminder_send_customer`, `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate`, `bullhorn_note_customer_visible`) require **synchronous consultant approval** before the send executes. The agent drafts; the consultant says yes; the transport fires; an audit row records the full chain.

Three paths were on the table for the v1.0 orange-tier approval mechanism:

| Option | Mechanism | v1.0 cost | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **D1-A** Bridge to cortextOS approval system | Concierge POSTs to an internal cortextOS approval API; operator approves in Brain UI; bridge calls back | ~2 days build (~3 days if approval-API doesn't yet exist) | Architecturally clean; reuses cortextOS primitive #4 (approval gates); UX in Brain UI is consistent with other approval flows | Brain UI v1.0 approval UX not yet built; depends on cortextOS approval-API stability; tightest coupling to upstream |
| **D1-B** Lightweight Telegram shim | Concierge posts to operator's tenant-bound Telegram chat: `[ID:<x>] APPROVE drafted email to <recipient>? /approve <ID> or /reject <ID>`; Concierge polls Telegram or receives webhook; on approve → transport executes | <1 day build | Reuses cortextOS primitive #5 (Telegram surface) already in place; consultants are on Telegram already; lowest engineering cost; clean audit chain (every approve/reject = `decision_log` row); works the same for Cash Conductor + Concierge | Approval UX is a chat reply rather than a rich panel; per-draft attachment preview is just a 200-char text snippet + vault path; consultant must read the vault Markdown if they want to see the full draft body before approving |
| **D1-C** No autosend; manual pickup | Concierge writes the draft to vault; sets `requires_consultant_action=true`; no notification; consultant manually polls vault and copies drafts to outbound | 0 days build (already supported by drafts-to-vault flow) | Zero risk of incorrect autosend; zero new build | UX is brutal; consultants miss drafts; defeats Concierge's "no candidate ghosted" promise; effectively kills Concierge as a v1.0 differentiator |

---

## Decision: D1-B (Telegram shim)

**Why D1-B wins for v1.0:**

1. **Cost-aligned to v1.0 scope.** D1-A's clean architecture is the right *v1.1+* answer once Brain UI matures; for v1.0 ship, D1-B's <1-day build matches the W10-13 Concierge slice budget.
2. **Reuses an already-built primitive.** cortextOS primitive #5 (Telegram surface) is in place; operators already receive escalation notifications there. Adding `/approve <ID>` / `/reject <ID>` commands extends an existing surface rather than introducing a new one.
3. **Audit chain is identical to D1-A.** Both paths emit the same `decision_log` rows (`xero_reminder_send_customer` orange action → operator approve/reject → transport `gmail_outlook_send_to_candidate` action). The Telegram interaction is the trigger, not the audit substrate.
4. **D1-C kills Concierge's value.** Manual vault polling means missed drafts means ghosted candidates means Concierge fails its Gate B (`ghosted-rate <5%`). Non-starter.

**Tradeoff accepted:** the approval UX is text-only on Telegram. Consultants who want to see the full draft body before approving open the vault path in the Telegram message. This is the same friction as reviewing an email draft in any other ticket system; acceptable for v1.0.

**v1.1+ upgrade path (queued, not blocking):** D1-A bridge to cortextOS approval system + Brain UI rich-panel approval surface. The D1-B Telegram path stays available as a fallback (e.g., operator on the move, away from a desk). v1.1+ adds the *option* of D1-A, doesn't replace D1-B.

## Implementation surface (delivered by Concierge W10-13 build slice)

1. **`packages/utilities/autosend-bridge-telegram/`** — small TypeScript package:
   - `proposeApproval(action_type, target, draft_preview, vault_path, timeout=PT4H) → approval_id`
   - Posts to operator's tenant Telegram chat with `[ID:<approval_id>]` + draft preview + vault path + `/approve <id>` / `/reject <id>` instructions.
   - Polls or webhooks for the operator's reply.
   - Returns `{outcome: approved | rejected | timeout, decided_by: <telegram_user_id>}`.
   - Timeout default `PT4H` per `escalation-codes.md` `ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` lines 348-353.
2. **Concierge `cycle.sh` Step 11** — calls `proposeApproval` for orange-tier drafts; on `approved`, proceeds to Step 12 transport; on `rejected` or `timeout`, fires `ESC_APPROVAL_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` (timeout) or records rejection in `decision_log` (rejected).
3. **Cash Conductor `cycle.sh` Step 10** — same `proposeApproval` call for `xero_reminder_send_customer` rows; identical handling.
4. **`tools.yaml` capability declarations** — add `autosend_bridge_telegram` capability to both Concierge and Cash Conductor.
5. **Tenant config — schema-work pending.** The natural storage location for the per-tenant operator Telegram chat-id is `tenant_adapters.config`, BUT the v0.3 supplement's `validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3` trigger hard-fails on unknown keys per Rule 2 — and `operator_telegram_chat_id` is NOT currently in the 6-key allowlist (`cash_conductor_last_run`, `concierge_last_poll`, `concierge_send_window`, `janitor_dedup_threshold`, the 2026-05-31 Janitor key, `blocked_recipients`). Resolution path: **W10-13 Concierge build slice lands a v0.4 supplement** adding `operator_telegram_chat_id` to the allowlist (type: string; required: false; set_by: tenant-admin; read_by: concierge + cash-conductor for the autosend-bridge consumer). Until then, the bridge consumer (`@ifos/autosend-bridge-telegram`) takes the chat-id as a function argument rather than reading it from tenant_adapters — the function-arg shim is already in place per the package scaffold landed 2026-06-01 (commit `9b282d8`). This decision-doc does NOT block on the schema work; D1-B's APPROVAL is structural (Telegram vs cortextOS approval system vs no-autosend); the storage-location detail is a W10-13 implementation question.

## Codex ratification

This decision doc ratifies via `.codex/ratification/review-architecture-decision.md` skill. Currently in flight under **cluster G** (`bash scripts/run-codex-ratification.sh --cluster G`); session-by-session ratification status is tracked in the closing Status-update line.

## Consequences

- **Concierge §9 Q1 RESOLVED** — strike from "open questions" list at next agent.md touch.
- **Cash Conductor §8 D1-pending fallback** — flips from "drafts-only if unresolved" to "orange-tier `xero_reminder_send_customer` writes are live once Concierge W10-13 lands the autosend-bridge production wiring."
- **Concierge ratification §10** — `Founder Decision D1 RESOLVED` blocker now satisfied. Remaining Concierge Proposed → Accepted blockers per §10: ADR-007 Accepted + Codex RATIFIED (DONE 2026-05-31 + Round 3), pilot LOI (PENDING), Bullhorn A+B (PENDING), founder approves §9 Q2-Q6 (PENDING).
- **Schema impact: v0.4 supplement required (deferred to W10-13 Concierge build slice).** D1-B requires a per-tenant operator-Telegram-chat-id storage location. `tenant_adapters.config` is the natural home BUT the v0.3 supplement's `validate_tenant_adapters_config_v0_3` trigger hard-fails on unknown keys per Rule 2 and `operator_telegram_chat_id` is NOT in the current allowlist (see implementation surface item 5 for the full rationale + interim function-arg-mode workaround). The schema work + migration land in the W10-13 Concierge build slice as part of bridge-production-wiring; the decision-doc itself is structurally complete without that schema work. The previously-stated "No schema impact" claim has been removed — it was inconsistent with implementation surface item 5.
- **No additional API keys/signups for the founder vault.** Day-4 provisioning (`docs/runbooks/day-4-provisioning.md` §6.5) creates the `_secrets.env` SKELETON only (touched empty at mode 0600); the Telegram bot token is populated by founder bootstrap (covered separately by tenant onboarding playbook — NOT Day-4), and the per-tenant operator chat-id is populated by tenant onboarding (W10-13 build slice; see implementation surface item 5 above). Once both are in place, no recurring credentials work — the bot token doesn't rotate per send; the chat-id is per-tenant-stable.
- **Schema-before-code discipline — interim acceptance.** The five rules (master brief §1) state schema-before-code. Today's state has the bridge package scaffold + consumer wiring landed BEFORE the schema supplement. The interim resolution is acceptable because the consumers run in **function-arg mode only** (chat-id passed as function argument, NOT read from `tenant_adapters`) — so no consumer code actually attempts to read the not-yet-allowlisted key. The schema-before-code rule is respected at the runtime level (no schema-violating read happens); the consumer scaffolding is fine to exist as long as the function-arg-only constraint holds until the v0.4 supplement lands.

**Status update:** Accepted on 2026-05-31 by founder-delegated arbitration (D1-B over D1-A and D1-C); package scaffold `@ifos/autosend-bridge-telegram` landed 2026-06-01 (commit `9b282d8`); consumer wiring landed on both Cash Conductor (commit `076e231`) and Concierge (commits `669a4f4` + `9ec2bd6`) — **in FUNCTION-ARG MODE only**, no `tenant_adapters.config.operator_telegram_chat_id` read attempts until the v0.4 schema supplement lands in the Concierge W10-13 build slice; Codex ratification currently in flight under cluster G (R2 closing 2026-06-02 per `docs/decisions/codex-disagreement-2026-06-02-*` ledger and the cluster G round-trip arc).
